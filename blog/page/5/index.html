  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I graduated from college, I thought I understood what it meant to develop software in the real world. It required process. It required troubleshooting. It required quality. However, to me, process meant waterfall. Troubleshooting meant trying a few things and then asking for help. Quality meant manual testing.</p>

<p>Agile methods were not unheard of when I graduated in 2001. My professors noted that iterative development was better than waterfall; they just only taught waterfall. Debuggers had been around since the 50’s, but my classmates and I still debugged with what I call &ldquo;Hi Mom!&rdquo; techniques. (We peppered our code with print statements.) Kent Beck had written the JUnit framework 4 years before, but it wasn’t entrenched in the Java culture yet. So it’s not surprising that my education didn’t cover these topics.</p>

<p>It took a few painful experiences in the real world to make me realize the way I programmed in college wasn’t the best way to engineer software. I needed to adopt some new practices.</p>

<p>Not much has changed in terms of software education. Being a part of Cerner’s software engineer training program, I am able to ask every group of new engineers three questions:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you use an agile process?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you use a debugger when troubleshooting your code?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you write automated unit tests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cerner has had explosive growth in engineering, so I’ve asked those questions of hundreds of recent graduates. Almost no one says yes. This told me that while colleges are doing a great job of teaching computer science, many schools are not teaching best practices in software development.</p>

<p>Until recently, Cerner wasn’t doing that great of a job of teaching them either. Our training program covered them, but we still saw the new engineers struggle to understand agile development, debug their code, and write their first unit test. One of Cerner’s core values is if you recognize something is broken, you are empowered to fix it. I knew our training program wasn’t working. It became my job to fix it.</p>

<p>Before tackling the whole program, I tried a little experiment. I wanted to see what it would take to get engineers in training to write just one unit test. At the time, training included a class on JUnit. In spite of the class, only 5% of the engineers were writing unit tests for training assignments.</p>

<p>To correct this, I started telling the engineers that I would take points off assignments that didn’t have a unit test. The idea was to create structural motivation. We immediately saw 40% of the engineers writing unit tests. A step forward, but it wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>The biggest obstacle to broader use of unit tests in training was that they didn’t know how to include the testing framework in their Java projects. That, more than the effort of writing the test, was keeping them from doing something we expected of them.</p>

<p>Something was wrong. We were teaching Maven in our training program. If you are not familiar with it, Maven helps you manage your project builds, and as a result, it helps you manage your dependencies. The engineers were already attending a class that taught them how to add dependencies to Java projects. They just weren’t able to associate what they had learned with the goal of bringing JUnit into their projects. They weren’t making the connection.</p>

<p>This connection was missed because engineers were learning about Maven in the absence of a problem. They were being told it’s an important tool, but we hadn’t given them a reason to use it. Later, when they did encounter the problem &ndash; &ldquo;How do I add the JUnit jar to my project?&rdquo; – it was too late. They had forgotten about Maven.</p>

<p>The key was to move the Maven training closer to when they needed the information. This is called &ldquo;Just in Time Teaching.&rdquo; It became the first requirement of the new program.</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect of my experiment is that 40% would write the tests even given the delay between training and practice. It should be obvious to anyone that’s ever taken a college programming class that some programmers can get it from lectures alone. Others have to practice. Any one-size-fits-all approach to training is flawed. The second requirement for the new program was that it must flex to meet the skills and learning styles of the engineers.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, I started the redesign of Cerner’s training program. My first step was to interview a large sample of our software leaders. I asked them what they wanted engineers to learn. Time and time again, the top answers would be agile development, debugging, and automated unit tests. Surprisingly, it was not a list of technologies like iOS, Hadoop, JSON, or ReST.</p>

<p>The resumes of our newly hired engineers are full of languages and technologies. However, when asked what they wanted of new engineers, our lead architects described practices. If Cerner could get engineers to improve in practices, we could take the great engineers we were hiring and immediately make them more productive.</p>

<p>The scary thing is that sharing knowledge is easy, but changing people’s behavior is hard. Once I realized our problems were about software development behavior and not knowledge, I realized we would need to completely rebuild the way Cerner trains its new engineers. The result is DevAcademy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-08-14-devacademy/DevAcademy.png" title="DevAcademy" ></p>

<p>Imagine you are a new engineer starting at Cerner. In your first week at Cerner, you report to the DevAcademy. The first two weeks focus on in-class instruction and assessment. The goal here is to introduce core software development behaviors and then assess your skills.</p>

<p>After completing the first two weeks of instruction, you join what we call the DevCenter and are assigned a real project. However, that project isn’t assigned by your team. You get to pick. The projects come from all over Cerner including web applications and services, tools to make engineers more productive, and even contributing to open source projects used by Cerner. In picking a project, you are telling Cerner the types of work you find interesting. This helps us determine the best place for you across our diverse range of solutions and technologies.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-08-14-devacademy/ManagersTalkingToEngineer1.jpg" title="Manager talking to engineer" ></p>

<p>While working on that first project, you have a dedicated mentor. You are expected to make progress on the project while receiving feedback. You also get just-in-time training on user stories, source code management, unit testing, and scrum. You get to use Cerner’s software development ecosystem in an isolated, safe environment.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-08-14-devacademy/Mentoring.jpg" title="Mentoring" ></p>

<p>Once you show readiness to join a team, you are allowed to demo your work to the teams that have open positions. Those teams can then pick the engineer that best fits their team. In this way, Cerner makes sure you are assigned to the right team for both Cerner and you.</p>

<p>DevAcademy recognizes that you should never stop learning, so the program continues well into your first few months on your team. You are offered classes on different technologies and more advanced topics as part of an elective-based training plan. You work with your manager to decide which classes to take. It’s Cerner’s way of making sure all of our engineers continue to grow.</p>

<p>We’ve had 150 engineers join DevAcademy since it was launched. I’ve had the privilege of seeing the new engineers struggle and then succeed on their projects. I’ve seen the light come on when they realize the usefulness good development practices and apply them effectively. I’ve seen them get excited about git and other powerful tools that they didn’t have the opportunity to learn during their formal educations. The best part of my job is that I’ve seen many very good engineers start down the career-long path towards becoming really great ones.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In software development, we solve problems. As we solve these problems, we build connections in our minds of how to look at a problem, relate it to previous problems and solutions, and re-apply past approaches and techniques.</p>

<p>These behavior habits build dogmatic ways of thinking and limit design choices to selective technologies we’ve used in the past. As we all know, you have to continually learn new technologies and different ways of thinking to stay current in the ever-changing landscape of software development. Unfortunately, keeping up-to-date on technologies and approaches isn’t an easy behavior to maintain when you have many other priorities.</p>

<p>This spring, a few engineers wanted to bring focus to this important behavior trait by giving a tech talk on &ldquo;Honing your Craft,&rdquo; which discussed how to continuously strengthen and refine skills. Not only did we want engineers that we work with on a daily basis to be part of the tech talk; we wanted engineers from other teams at Cerner to be involved too. Also, we didn’t just want to talk about it; we wanted to pose a challenge to put people into action and re-enforce these behaviors.</p>

<p>At the end of the talk, we announced the challenge: 30 days of code. It was a challenge like many other &ldquo;30 day&rdquo; programs but was centered on learning new aspects of software development, languages, or just hacking up a tool that you find useful for your day-to-day development. The goal being that after 30 days, new habits and behaviors would be established to help promote continuous learning.</p>

<p>To make this a social learning experience, we built a Ruby web application called &ldquo;mural&rdquo; using async_sinatra and eventmachine to consume our GitHub Enterprise instance and show gists, which contained a code comment of &ldquo;30_days_of_code&rdquo;. The result was really interesting. Similar to Twitter, where you follow a specific hashtag, we were following code snippets of fellow developers. Since most of them were gists, they were small enough so you could easily see what they were doing (without having to go through a mountain of code). With this dashboard, a score was calculated based on count of your posts and was displayed with your avatar. Having scores displayed in descending order added a little peer pressure to keep people active in challenge.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-08-06-the-30-days-of-code-experiment/30-Days-of-Code.png" width="30" title="Days of Code" ></p>

<p>By the time I got back to my desk, I received questions of where the URL was to see the app, so they could verify their posts were showing. Soon, people wanted GitHub repos to show up with gists, so a pull request was requested for that. We then wanted anonymous gists to also get pulled in, which required developing our own crawler since these were exposed on the gist search. It was apparent that people wanted to share what they were doing, and people wanted to see it.</p>

<p>At the end of the challenge, we returned to the auditorium to highlight some of the posts that came in over the past month. During the 30 days, we had 124 gists posted and 17 different contributions in repos. People were showing their skills over a wide range of technologies. Examples were:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Building a plugin to invoke Jenkins commands over a phone (using Siri)</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby scripts that interact with our Github Enterprise instance API that will send out emails when pull requests or branches are getting old (executed periodically through Jenkins)</p></li>
<li><p>Clojure application that looks for pull requests based on Github organizations, which have two &ldquo;+1&rdquo; comments (alerting which pull request may be candidates to close out)</p></li>
<li><p>Illustrating Crucible code interactions by extracting data with python and visualizing with D3
Using Node.js to flash lights on a Raspberry Pi when a health check from web service is failing</p></li>
<li><p>Presenting statistics from a storm cluster with Rickshaw</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Eleven people presented what they worked on and learned. It was amazing to see all of the different ideas people came up with in this time frame.</p>

<p>Even more interesting was how quickly people learned from the ideas of others. Not only were developers sharing their code snippets, but they were also sharing the problem they were attempting to solve or the idea of what they wanted invent. For example, the Ruby script which alerted the last committer of a dead branch through email, spawned into other implementations that would send alerts based on different pieces of Github data (ex. old pull requests). Sharing these ideas in their early stages (through code snippets) really accelerates the rate that an idea can be seeded in other minds and helps inspire even more innovation and learning.</p>

<p>This wasn&rsquo;t only a challenge of what we would build, but it was also an experiment of what can happen by taking a small portion of your day and doing something different. By structuring this exercise around a formal challenge that included a competitive aspect, there was additional motivation to get involved and stay involved to the end.</p>

<p>In summary, find a way to take a little time out of your day to try something different; you will be amazed with the different perspectives that you gain.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>This is the blog form of the Thinking in MapReduce talk at StampedeCon 2013. I’ve linked to existing resources for some items discussed in the talk, but the structure and major points are here.</em></p>

<p>We programmers have had it pretty good over the years. In almost all cases, hardware scaled up faster than data size and complexity. Unfortunately, this is changing for many of us. Moore&rsquo;s Law has taken on a new direction; we gain power with parallel processing rather than faster clock cycles. More importantly, the volume of data we need to work with has grown exponentially.</p>

<p>Tackling this problem is tremendously important in healthcare. At the most basic level, healthcare data is too often fragmented and incomplete: an individual’s medical data is spread across multiple systems for different venues of care. Such fragmentation means no one has the complete picture of a person’s health and that means decisions are made with incomplete information. One thing we’re doing at Cerner is securely bringing together this information to enable a number of improvements, ranging from better-informed decisions to understanding and improving the health of entire populations of people. This is only possible with data at huge scale.</p>

<p>This is also opening new opportunities; Peter Norvig shows in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvDCzhbjYWs">Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data</a> how simple models over many data points can perform better than complex models with fewer points. Our challenge is to apply this to some of the most complicated and most important data sets that exist.</p>

<h2>New problems and new solutions</h2>

<p>Our first thought may be to tackle such problems using the proven, successful strategy of relational databases. This has lots of advantages, especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID semantics</a> that are easy to reason about and make strong guarantees about correctness. The downside is such guarantees require strong coordination between machines involved and in many cases the cost of that coordination grows as the square of data size.  Such models should be used whenever they can, but to reason about huge data sets holistically means we have to consider different tradeoffs.</p>

<p>So we need new approaches for these problems. Some are clear upfront: as data becomes too large to scale up on single machines, we must scale out across many. Going further, we reach a point where we have too much data to move across a network &mdash; so rather than moving data to our computation, we must move computation to data.</p>

<p>In fact, these simple assertions form the foundation of MapReduce: we move computation to data by running map functions across individual records without moving them over the network and merge and combine, or reduce, the output of those functions into a meaningful result. <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/WordCount">Word count</a> is the prototypical example of this pattern in action. MapReduce implementations as offered by Hadoop actually offer a bit more than this, with the following phases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Map</em> &mdash; transform or filter individual input records</p></li>
<li><p><em>Combine</em> &mdash; optional partial merge of map outputs in the mapping process, usually for efficiency</p></li>
<li><p><em>Shuffle and Sort</em> &mdash; Sort the output of map operations by an arbitrary key and partition map output across reducers</p></li>
<li><p><em>Reduce</em> &mdash; Process the shuffled map output in the sorted order, emitting our final result.</p></li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-07-31-thinking-in-mapreduce/MapReduce1.png" title="MapReduce" ></p>

<p>We have our building blocks: we can split data across many machines and apply simple functions against them. Hadoop and MapReduce support this pattern well.  Now we need to answer two questions: How do we use these building blocks effectively and how do we create higher-level value on top of them?</p>

<p>The first step is to maximize parallelism. The most efficient MapReduce jobs shift as much work into the map phase as possible, even to the point where there is little or no data that needs to be sent across the network to the reducer. We can gauge the gains made by scaling out by applying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law">Amdahl’s Law</a> where the parallelism is the amount of work we can do in map tasks versus more serial reduce-side operations.</p>

<p>The second step is to compose our <em>map, combine, shuffle, sort, and reduce</em> primitives into higher-level operations. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Join</em> &mdash; Send distinct inputs to map tasks, and combine them with a common key in the reducers.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Map-Side Join</em> &mdash; When one data set is much smaller than another, it may be more efficient to simply load it in each map task, eliminating the reduce phase overhead outright.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Aggregation</em> &mdash; Summarizes big data to be easily computed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Loading into external systems</em> &mdash; The output of the above operations can be exported to dedicated tools like R to do further analysis.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Beyond that, the above operations can be composed into sophisticated process flows to take data from several complex sources, join it together, and distill it down into useful knowledge. The book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025122.do">MapReduce Design Patterns</a> discusses all of these patterns and more.</p>

<h2>Higher-Level APIs</h2>

<p>Understanding the above patterns is important but much like how higher-level languages have grown dominant, higher-level libraries have replaced direct MapReduce jobs. At Cerner, we make extensive use of <a href="http://crunch.apache.org">Apache Crunch</a> for our processing infrastructure and of <a href="http://hive.apache.org">Apache Hive</a> for querying data sitting in Hadoop.</p>

<h2>Reasoning About the System</h2>

<p>Most of development history has focused on variations on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values">Place-Oriented Programming</a>, where we have data in objects or database rows and we apply change by updating our data in place.  Yet such a model doesn’t align with MapReduce; when dealing with mass processing of very large data sets, the complexity and inefficiency involved in individual updates becomes overwhelming. The system would become too complicated to perform or reason about. The result is a simple axiom for processing pipelines: <em>start with the questions you want to ask and then transform the data to answer them.</em> Re-processing huge data sets at any time is what Hadoop does best and we can leverage that to view the world as pure functions of our data, rather than trying to juggle in-place updates.</p>

<p>In short, the MapReduce view of the world is a holistic function of your raw data. There are techniques for processing incremental change and persisting processing steps for efficiency but these are optimizations. Start by processing all data holistically and adjust from there.</p>

<h2>Beyond MapReduce</h2>

<p>The paper <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~alon/files/dataspacesDec05.pdf">From Databases to Dataspaces</a> discusses a new view of integrating and leveraging data. A similar idea has entered the lexicon under the label &ldquo;Data Lake&rdquo; but the principles align: securely bring structured and unstructured data together and apply massive computation to it at any time for any new need. Existing systems are good at efficiently executing known query paths but require a lot of up-front work, either by creating new data models or building out infrastructure for the immediate need. Conversely, Hadoop and MapReduce allow us to ask questions about our data in parallel at massive scale without prior build.</p>

<p>This becomes more powerful as Hadoop becomes a more general fabric for computation. Projects like <a href="http://spark-project.org">Spark</a> can be layered on top of Hadoop to significantly improve processing time for many jobs. SQL- and search-based systems allow faster interrogation of data directly in Hadoop to a wider set of users and domain-specific data models can be quickly computed for new needs.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the gap between the discovery of a novel question and our ability to answer it is shrinking dramatically. The rate of innovation is increasing.</p>

<p>Cerner places a high value on talent development programs offering students the experience to build practical and tangible skills for the modern work environment. As part of this focus, Cerner supports FIRST Robotics, a competition providing experience in software engineering, where students learn to deal with complexity, time constraints, quality, and technical communications. Sound familiar? I wish they had this program when I was a kid!</p>

<p>High school students from Kansas City will be testing their minds, willpower, and teamwork in this global robotics championship competition April 24-27 in St Louis, Missouri. The secret game design was revealed in January, and with just six weeks to build, over 2,000 teams created completely unique robots. Design, engineering, metal fabrication, project management, marketing, and fundraising are all activities that students gain exposure to in this real-world project. Most importantly, they practice creative problem solving in complex team dynamics.</p>

<p>The championship teams you may have seen in the Kansas City Regional are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Team 1710 &ndash; The Ravonics Revolution</li>
<li>Team 1730 &ndash; Team Driven</li>
<li>Team 1806 &ndash; S.W.A.T.</li>
<li>Team 1939 &ndash; The Kuh-nig-its</li>
<li>Team 1986 &ndash; Team Titanium</li>
<li>Team 1987 &ndash; Broncobots</li>
<li>Team 3528 &ndash; Up Next!</li>
</ul>


<p>Students are challenged with two software programming components: digital media marketing and robot controls. Students will use a wide range of web, mobile, and media development technologies to create their team&rsquo;s marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Robot controls is broken down into two types: autonomous and teleoperated programs. In autonomous mode the robot responds exclusively to preprogrammed commands based on sensor feedback from a camera, accelerometer, gyro, encoders, and more. In teleoperated mode, the robot continues to use sensors but now can receive input from the drive team using game joysticks.</p>

<p>Students can use three different programming languages for the robot control system:</p>

<ol>
<li>LabVIEW from National Instruments</li>
<li>C++ with Wind River Workbench</li>
<li>Java with Netbeans</li>
</ol>


<p>The most important tool for control system programmers is a white board. Students diagram and visualize all the inputs and outputs of each system: motors, actuators, sensors, and driver station. Mapping inputs to outputs is important not just during the construction of the program, but it also helps to train the drive team. Students use online resources, collaborate with other teams, and receive guidance from their technical mentors. Practicing resourcefulness prepares them for the complex professional engineering environment they will soon become a member of.</p>

<p>Cerner is engaged in the Kansas City community at many levels. We are a sustaining partner in the KC STEM Alliance. Many Cerner associates mentor local teams, volunteer at local events, and are involved parents. These experiences exercise student minds in very real and practical ways. They are more prepared for technical and non-technical Cerner careers. Their passion and commitment is the fuel for delivering our future innovation.</p>

<p>Here is this year’s gameplay video:</p>
