  <div class="entry-content"><p>Providing opportunities for students to gain experience in software development and grow the skills necessary to excel in their careers after graduation is a top priority for Cerner Engineering. Our annual Software Intern Program gives students insight into the design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance of large-scale software projects, which are often beyond the scope of the typical academic experience.</p>

<p>In 2013, we had a total of 224 interns across all business segments with 107 placed into the Software Intern Program to grow their experience as Software Engineers. Each intern was placed on an engineering team, paired with a dedicated mentor, and immediately began learning to use industry-standard tools and processes. They worked on real projects that will ultimately end up in the hands of our clients and play a part in transforming healthcare through the use of technology.</p>

<p>This summer, interns worked on a wide variety of projects spanning from Eclipse RCP applications, Web services, iPad applications, or working with Big Data in the cloud. They used Java, iOS, Ruby, .NET, and many other technologies to solve problems and create new solutions to ensure each intern learned something new while challenging them to take away a new set of skills at the end of their summer experience.</p>

<p>But it’s not all work &ndash; the summer schedule was full of opportunities to learn about Kansas City, Healthcare, network with other interns in the program, and have as much fun as possible. This year, we kicked off the internship program at a <a href="http://www.sportingkc.com/">Sporting KC</a> soccer game, including a private tailgating event. Interns also got a chance to experience the <a href="http://www.jewell.edu/tucker">Tucker Leadership Lab</a>, attend lunchtime tech-talks, participate in a CodeRetreat, attend our annual Developer’s Conference (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE0YoFg-hkE">DevCon</a>), go to <a href="https://www.worldsoffun.com/">Worlds of Fun</a>, and go on tours around Kansas City to learn more about the different parts of town and what makes this a great place to live and work.</p>

<p>One of the most fun events this past summer was the <strong>Software Intern Hackfest</strong>. An optional event, Interns formed teams of 2-4 and were given a week with the goal of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dream it.</li>
<li>Build it.</li>
<li>Present it.</li>
<li>Profit!!!</li>
</ol>


<p>The teams were given a week to build anything they wanted and presented the end result to a panel of Cerner software developers for prizes and glory. We took some time to sit down with two of the winning teams to get their thoughts on the Hackfest and their overall experience with the internship program.</p>

<h2>Grand Prize winners: <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/engineers/team-golf/">Team Golf</a></h2>

<p><strong>Addison Shaw, Richard Habeeb</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> Describe your project and how you created it.</p>

<p><strong>A&amp;R:</strong> When we came up with the project, we thought, in one week, how far could we push ourselves? Let&rsquo;s do a game. We wanted a challenge.</p>

<p>We chose JavaScript because neither of us had much experience with it previously. JavaScript is really cool because it has a lot of game frameworks already. We found KineticJS &ndash; it mainly handled the html 5 canvas. It lets you do simple animations, rotations, and scaling.</p>

<p>When we were coming up with the design of the game, it was more of a &ldquo;create as you go&rdquo; project. We didn&rsquo;t just sit down and immediately come up with a game of aliens, cows and robots. We started out with a framework.</p>

<p>We wanted the game to be dynamically generated, and we wanted it to be a traditional survival game.</p>

<p>We knew it had to be 2-d. We built the framework with a grid structure. We made all the graphics ourselves with a pixelater.</p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> What were your biggest takeaways?</p>

<p><strong>Addison:</strong> I learned a lot of JavaScript and CSS Less along the way. I&rsquo;m a lot more interested in web development now. I also learned that it&rsquo;s okay to go well into the night to finish a project, and it relates to the real-life work environment. Knowing that we were competing against other teams and having the hard stop was motivation. We knew it didn&rsquo;t have to be perfect; we just had to finish.</p>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong> I called it free motivation. It&rsquo;s a competition, and there&rsquo;s that side of me that wants to do really well. There&rsquo;s also a deadline. It&rsquo;s a chance to show off your work to others. The project was very self-directed. We came up with the tools and decided it ourselves. The creativity part was awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> What was the most fun?</p>

<p><strong>Addison:</strong> I had Richard over to my house one day. We bought a bunch of snack food and red bull and worked on the game. My mom got us a pizza and it was really fun! We also did some trash talking with other interns. That was fun.</p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> What will you do with your prize? (Raspberry Pi)</p>

<p><strong>Addison:</strong> It was an awesome prize! I want to do something with home automation. We are living in a house [at college] this year. Maybe I’ll create something like clap on lights.</p>

<p><strong>Richard:</strong> I do robotics a lot during the school year and I was thinking of working with it at our club.</p>

<h2>Crowd Favorite: <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/engineers/team-mad-scientists/">Mad Scientists</a></h2>

<p><strong>Alex Valentine, George Li, Jack Miles</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> Describe your project and how you created it.</p>

<p><strong>Alex:</strong> It was my idea to make a game. For the longest time, we didn’t know what we wanted to do. Originally we were going to make a 2-D game. We thought it would be easy not making that 3rd dimension. There is a game that puts 2D and 3D together. It looked really simple and easy. So we went with that.</p>

<p><strong>Jack:</strong> A few of us weren’t familiar with C#.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> We all liked to play video games! We used Unity to create it. Someone told me if you want to learn Git you should forget everything about SVN. That didn’t necessarily happen for me.</p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> How did you communicate the tasks that needed to be done?</p>

<p><strong>Alex:</strong> We assigned people different aspects of the game. I took characters.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> I took responsibilities for weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I took charge of enemies.</p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> How did you deal with integration?</p>

<p><strong>Jack:</strong> For the longest time Git was giving me problems. I was on a Mac and they were on PCs.</p>

<p><strong>Alex:</strong> We learned that we should never commit directly to the master branch. Making mistakes and then figuring out how to fix them really helped me learn Git.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> I learned more about Git than creating the game and ended up giving a lightning talk on Git. The Unity engine isn’t setup well for source control. We would have to diff in different stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> You learned some new technologies – what else did you learn?</p>

<p><strong>Alex:</strong> Start early. Be efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Jack:</strong> If you’re working on new technologies, learn each technology before going too deep. That way when we’re trying to do real work, you aren’t worrying about how to use it.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> It was about Wednesday when we still didn’t have anything working. When he told me, &ldquo;I’ll be happy if it shoots,&rdquo; I knew we were in trouble. [Editor’s Note: At the competition, the main character was able to shoot, but only backwards, which was a huge crowd pleaser]</p>

<p><strong>Alex:</strong> When you realize that what you were going to do and your deadline are not going to jive, what do you do? We decided we wanted one of everything instead of having multiples of everything. We needed to scale our project down a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Cerner:</strong> What was the most fun?</p>

<p><strong>Alex:</strong> The lunch meetings were pretty entertaining!</p>

<p><strong>Jack:</strong> The &ldquo;fun&rdquo; of frustration. The [other teams&#8217;] presentations were fun for me because, although we set the goal and didn’t quite make it, you could tell there were a lot of people in the same situation. Everyone who has worked on software has been in our position.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Improving the state of healthcare through innovation requires investing in others to join you on the journey; not just for today, but for the decades to come.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-09-11-project-lead-the-way/PLTWlogo.jpeg" title="Project Lead the Way" ></p>

<p>Project Lead the Way has established the Computer Science and Software Enginering course that teaches computational thinking to high school students, and it will pilot in 60 schools across the country this fall. Providing exposure to a wide variety of computational and computer science concepts, students can program a story or game in Scratch, write a mobile application for Android, and learn about knowledge discovery and data mining, computer simulation, cybersecurity, GUI programming, web development, version control, and agile software development.</p>

<p>Recently, I had the privilege of working with experts across the country to define the curriculum for Project Lead the Way as well as the opportunity to sit in on the training sessions given to the pilot teachers, hosted at Cerner&rsquo;s Innovation Campus. Bennett Brown, Director of Curriculum and Instruction, led the class into the deep end to solve the hard problems their students would face throughout the course. Experts augmented the training sessions from organizations such as Cerner, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Purdue University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Virginia, and more.</p>

<p>While the Computer Science and Software Engineering course (CSE) isn&rsquo;t focused specifically on programming, students will pick up introductory skills in a number of languages and environments including Python, MIT App Inventor, JavaScript, Logo, and Scratch among others. As software developers, we all have our origin stories with what sparked our interest in programming; there was a particular moment for each of us where we solved a problem and saw firsthand the power of what software can create. The CSE course seeks to generate those sparks through activities, projects, and problem-based learning.</p>

<p>This course follows in the footsteps of other Project Lead the Way courses in engineering and biomedical science currently operating in over 4,700 schools with more than 10,000 trained teachers.</p>

<h2><strong>What I Learned</strong></h2>

<p>My role in the class was to teach one simple section and provide some practical answers from the industry trenches. I&rsquo;ll let you in on a secret: I&rsquo;m pretty sure I learned more about teaching and how to teach novices than I taught on any particular topic.</p>

<p>Problems and projects in PLTW are designed to be approachable by all students; there is no ceiling for the advanced students who want to go beyond what is specifically covered. The teachers receiving training were given the same end-of-unit problems that their students will face during the year and had to work out solutions in a pair programming environment, often working in their dorms or in the Cerner training rooms until 10pm. The experience level of teachers ranged from those having engineering degrees and multiple years of industry experience before going into teaching to some who had never programmed in their lives before this class.</p>

<p>What I learned was that even in this environment of mixed skill levels, the activity/project/problem-based approach surprisingly requires just a minimal introduction to a new concept. After simple activities which build quick wins, natural curiosity swells up within each of the students; skill and understanding start to form, not just learning a particular technology but how to problem solve using software.</p>

<p>For example, during the App Inventor sections, teachers received step-by-step simple examples of putting together programming blocks to create a simple Android application before working on homework to through one Agile sprint with their partner that evening to come up with their own application from scratch. The next morning, pairs went through their demos in a rotating show-and-tell fashion, showing a variety of apps including a flash card game, as well as a &ldquo;one of these things is not like the other&rdquo; game using the accelerometer for randomization and featuring the appropriate Sesame Street music.</p>

<p>One night during the course I pulled down the Codea app for my iPad and showed my own kids the relationship between a few behaviors in a physics app and the corresponding code in Lua. Three hours later, all of the iPads in the house were engaged in hacking.</p>

<p>In addition to some great instruction over the course from Bennett Brown on a variety of problems in genetics, chaos theory, Tkinter and GUI programming, other highlights included:</p>

<p><a href="https://www-eng.llnl.gov/bios/bios_castillo.html">Vic Castillo</a>, Group Leader in the Quantitative Risk Analysis at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories with a PhD in computational physics gave a great three hour survey presentation on what he sees as the &ldquo;big three&rdquo; topics in the future of computing: computer simulation and modeling (a subject near and dear to my own origin stories in computing), 3-D printing and mobile robotics featuring almost a dozen demos of cases where modeling was used to learn something new about a real-world system or design. Using just the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> multi-agent programmable modeling environment developed at Northwestern University, Vic showed a variety of models that could be built with just a basic knowledge of the Logo programming language: for instance, modeling the heat absorption of a home design and how different designs and window configurations affect the internal temperature of the living space), &ldquo;solving&rdquo; the game Lunar Lander, or how a First Robotics team modeled the software algorithms incorporated into their <a href="http://turtlebot.com">TurtleBot</a> (think Roomba + netbook + Kinect sensor).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-09-11-project-lead-the-way/Netlogo.png" title="NetLogo" ></p>

<p><a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~jlc6j/">Joanne Cohoon</a> talked about achieving diversity in STEM classrooms and the state of the job market&mdash;how 50% of the jobs available involve some need for computational thinking and the challenges and how teachers can create classroom environments that attract students who might otherwise rule themselves out from the start based on the stereotypes and environments commonly surrounding STEM in schools. With half the workforce needing some kind of computational skill, we can&rsquo;t drive anyone away.</p>

<p>Peter Chapman, a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University and Technical Leader of the <a href="https://picoctf.com">picoCTF</a> project joined us via Skype to describe the program. Set up along the storyline of an interactive adventure called Toaster Wars, picoCTF is a competition among high school students to solve as many of 57 challenges as they can using whatever means necessary&mdash;hacking, decrypting, reverse engineering, breaking or whatever. The challenges force students to get their hands dirty, learning on their own via documentation and their browser the role of cookies in web security, how to use grep and tar to find a secret key in a file, and other examples designed to give students the experience of tackling unknown problems using the resources available to them.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-09-11-project-lead-the-way/Toaster-War.png" title="Toaster War" ></p>

<p>Cerner interns and former Lee&rsquo;s Summit High School Team Driven First Robotics team members Dakota Ewigman and Victoria Utter taught a condensed version of the <a href="http://kcpowersource.com/appcamp/">KC Power Source Android App Camp</a> using <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu">MIT App Inventor</a> which set the stage for more advanced App Inventor instruction provided by Dave O&#8217;Larte around calling and integrating web services and open APIs. We had developed a simple ballot and question and answer database-backed web service that let students and teachers hack around independently. In the category of unintended learning, and no doubt inspired by their picoCTF hacking, some of the teachers quickly found out how to troll other schools&#8217; services by injecting funny questions and answers about the course material.</p>

<h2><strong>Why It&rsquo;s Cool</strong></h2>

<p>At one point during the week, Bennett Brown shared with me the growth potential for PLTW&rsquo;s CSE program. In the engineering and biomedical engineering pathways, the year-over-year growth has been tremendous which is paving the way for an even faster uptake of the computer science offering. Such an important and widespread channel offers a great opportunity to influence the future of our entire industry and communities. With around 20% of the total pilot schools in this curriculum, Kansas City is getting a head start on building this pool of talent. We can use little advantages such as these to increase the value of KC as a hub for computing and entrepreneurial activity.</p>

<p>An instructor asked me at one point, &ldquo;What is Cerner looking for in high school students who take this course?&rdquo; I had the sense that the question sought an answer more about a specific technology or language. I don&rsquo;t really see that as the focus. Instead, I think what we want is defined more by sparking that interest in solving hard problems and coming away with the understanding that these problems exist in their community and that there are people in the community at companies like Cerner solving those problems every day.</p>

<h2><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h2>

<p>We have a lot to accomplish in &ldquo;engineering health,&rdquo; and K-12 outreach programs can feel like a long game that often take a back seat to immediate concerns around designing and shipping solutions. But seeing how even the less computing-savvy teachers started to get hooked on programming their Android devices or trying to get to the next level in picoCTF while beating their heads against man pages and HTTP dumps, it became clear to me that by getting involved in these programs we can accelerate not only the numbers of students comfortable with computational thinking, but also give them a network of relationships and experiences in their own communities to return to as their career and learning progresses. The long game may not be as long as we think.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(This is a joint post by <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/engineers/frank-rydzewski/">Frank Rydzewski</a> and <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/engineers/kevin-shekleton/">Kevin Shekleton</a>)</p>

<p>This past June, 2,500 associates from across Cerner came together for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE0YoFg-hkE">DevCon</a>, our internal developers conference. Now in its 3rd year, DevCon is a two-day, engineering-led conference that was created to bring together Cerner associates involved in all aspects of development and technology. DevCon is organized and run like many other developer conferences, complete with a call for papers and a talk selection committee. This year, we had 80 talks covering a wide array of topics such as big data, user experience and design, DevOps, and mobile development.</p>

<p>A keynote presentation kicks off each day followed by talks across multiple tracks. <a href="https://twitter.com/skeptomai">Chris Brown</a>, CTO of <a href="http://www.opscode.com/">Opscode</a>, the creators of the open-source <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Home">Chef Platform</a>, kicked off DevCon this year with a talk on the emergence and importance of DevOps. Within engineering at Cerner, embracing DevOps has had a big cultural impact on how we approach the software and systems we write and operate.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/D2hK5WpYaWc?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p><a href="http://davehogue.com/">David Hogue</a>, a leading Interaction Designer and instructor at San Francisco State University, kicked off the second day talking about the importance of interaction design in business and software. Hogue&rsquo;s keynote was especially relevant to us as interaction designers play a prominent role in the creation and maintenance of our software.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zaeGuPT1m2o?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>As you can see from the two keynote videos, the visual theme for DevCon this year was 8-bit gaming. Two 1980’s living room setups, packed with vintage NES consoles, CRT televisions, and piles of classic games, provided entertainment and nostalgia during the breaks in the conference schedule. At night, 20 teams competed for bragging rights and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_Duo">awesome</a> <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com/">prizes</a> at Geek Trivia Night, answering questions ranging from <em>name the sci-fi spaceships</em> to <em>identify the programming language from a snippet of code</em>.</p>

<p>As in previous years, DevCon ends with lightning talks in which anyone can present on a topic of their choosing provided it lasts for no more than 5 minutes. Lightning talks at DevCon can cover the gamut. Past lightning talks have covered Monads in Scala, a visual tour of Comic-Con, and world record strategies in Donkey Kong.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also made available the DevCon 2012 keynote presentations, both from <a href="http://drjeffnorris.com/">Dr. Jeff Norris</a>, a scientist at NASA JPL responsible for the robotic spacecraft in the solar system. Norris talked on remaining agile while working on mission critical systems as well as the importance of specialization in the advancement of fields &mdash; both of these talks are well worth watching.</p>

<p>DevCon allows engineers across organizations to come together to learn and present on a variety of topics, fostering a culture of innovation. It is no wonder then that many engineers at Cerner cite DevCon as their favorite and most anticipated event within Cerner.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I graduated from college, I thought I understood what it meant to develop software in the real world. It required process. It required troubleshooting. It required quality. However, to me, process meant waterfall. Troubleshooting meant trying a few things and then asking for help. Quality meant manual testing.</p>

<p>Agile methods were not unheard of when I graduated in 2001. My professors noted that iterative development was better than waterfall; they just only taught waterfall. Debuggers had been around since the 50’s, but my classmates and I still debugged with what I call &ldquo;Hi Mom!&rdquo; techniques. (We peppered our code with print statements.) Kent Beck had written the JUnit framework 4 years before, but it wasn’t entrenched in the Java culture yet. So it’s not surprising that my education didn’t cover these topics.</p>

<p>It took a few painful experiences in the real world to make me realize the way I programmed in college wasn’t the best way to engineer software. I needed to adopt some new practices.</p>

<p>Not much has changed in terms of software education. Being a part of Cerner’s software engineer training program, I am able to ask every group of new engineers three questions:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you use an agile process?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you use a debugger when troubleshooting your code?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you write automated unit tests?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cerner has had explosive growth in engineering, so I’ve asked those questions of hundreds of recent graduates. Almost no one says yes. This told me that while colleges are doing a great job of teaching computer science, many schools are not teaching best practices in software development.</p>

<p>Until recently, Cerner wasn’t doing that great of a job of teaching them either. Our training program covered them, but we still saw the new engineers struggle to understand agile development, debug their code, and write their first unit test. One of Cerner’s core values is if you recognize something is broken, you are empowered to fix it. I knew our training program wasn’t working. It became my job to fix it.</p>

<p>Before tackling the whole program, I tried a little experiment. I wanted to see what it would take to get engineers in training to write just one unit test. At the time, training included a class on JUnit. In spite of the class, only 5% of the engineers were writing unit tests for training assignments.</p>

<p>To correct this, I started telling the engineers that I would take points off assignments that didn’t have a unit test. The idea was to create structural motivation. We immediately saw 40% of the engineers writing unit tests. A step forward, but it wasn’t enough.</p>

<p>The biggest obstacle to broader use of unit tests in training was that they didn’t know how to include the testing framework in their Java projects. That, more than the effort of writing the test, was keeping them from doing something we expected of them.</p>

<p>Something was wrong. We were teaching Maven in our training program. If you are not familiar with it, Maven helps you manage your project builds, and as a result, it helps you manage your dependencies. The engineers were already attending a class that taught them how to add dependencies to Java projects. They just weren’t able to associate what they had learned with the goal of bringing JUnit into their projects. They weren’t making the connection.</p>

<p>This connection was missed because engineers were learning about Maven in the absence of a problem. They were being told it’s an important tool, but we hadn’t given them a reason to use it. Later, when they did encounter the problem &ndash; &ldquo;How do I add the JUnit jar to my project?&rdquo; – it was too late. They had forgotten about Maven.</p>

<p>The key was to move the Maven training closer to when they needed the information. This is called &ldquo;Just in Time Teaching.&rdquo; It became the first requirement of the new program.</p>

<p>Another interesting aspect of my experiment is that 40% would write the tests even given the delay between training and practice. It should be obvious to anyone that’s ever taken a college programming class that some programmers can get it from lectures alone. Others have to practice. Any one-size-fits-all approach to training is flawed. The second requirement for the new program was that it must flex to meet the skills and learning styles of the engineers.</p>

<p>With these goals in mind, I started the redesign of Cerner’s training program. My first step was to interview a large sample of our software leaders. I asked them what they wanted engineers to learn. Time and time again, the top answers would be agile development, debugging, and automated unit tests. Surprisingly, it was not a list of technologies like iOS, Hadoop, JSON, or ReST.</p>

<p>The resumes of our newly hired engineers are full of languages and technologies. However, when asked what they wanted of new engineers, our lead architects described practices. If Cerner could get engineers to improve in practices, we could take the great engineers we were hiring and immediately make them more productive.</p>

<p>The scary thing is that sharing knowledge is easy, but changing people’s behavior is hard. Once I realized our problems were about software development behavior and not knowledge, I realized we would need to completely rebuild the way Cerner trains its new engineers. The result is DevAcademy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-08-14-devacademy/DevAcademy.png" title="DevAcademy" ></p>

<p>Imagine you are a new engineer starting at Cerner. In your first week at Cerner, you report to the DevAcademy. The first two weeks focus on in-class instruction and assessment. The goal here is to introduce core software development behaviors and then assess your skills.</p>

<p>After completing the first two weeks of instruction, you join what we call the DevCenter and are assigned a real project. However, that project isn’t assigned by your team. You get to pick. The projects come from all over Cerner including web applications and services, tools to make engineers more productive, and even contributing to open source projects used by Cerner. In picking a project, you are telling Cerner the types of work you find interesting. This helps us determine the best place for you across our diverse range of solutions and technologies.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-08-14-devacademy/ManagersTalkingToEngineer1.jpg" title="Manager talking to engineer" ></p>

<p>While working on that first project, you have a dedicated mentor. You are expected to make progress on the project while receiving feedback. You also get just-in-time training on user stories, source code management, unit testing, and scrum. You get to use Cerner’s software development ecosystem in an isolated, safe environment.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-08-14-devacademy/Mentoring.jpg" title="Mentoring" ></p>

<p>Once you show readiness to join a team, you are allowed to demo your work to the teams that have open positions. Those teams can then pick the engineer that best fits their team. In this way, Cerner makes sure you are assigned to the right team for both Cerner and you.</p>

<p>DevAcademy recognizes that you should never stop learning, so the program continues well into your first few months on your team. You are offered classes on different technologies and more advanced topics as part of an elective-based training plan. You work with your manager to decide which classes to take. It’s Cerner’s way of making sure all of our engineers continue to grow.</p>

<p>We’ve had 150 engineers join DevAcademy since it was launched. I’ve had the privilege of seeing the new engineers struggle and then succeed on their projects. I’ve seen the light come on when they realize the usefulness good development practices and apply them effectively. I’ve seen them get excited about git and other powerful tools that they didn’t have the opportunity to learn during their formal educations. The best part of my job is that I’ve seen many very good engineers start down the career-long path towards becoming really great ones.</p>
