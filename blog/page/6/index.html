<p>Cerner places a high value on talent development programs offering students the experience to build practical and tangible skills for the modern work environment. As part of this focus, Cerner supports FIRST Robotics, a competition providing experience in software engineering, where students learn to deal with complexity, time constraints, quality, and technical communications. Sound familiar? I wish they had this program when I was a kid!</p>

<p>High school students from Kansas City will be testing their minds, willpower, and teamwork in this global robotics championship competition April 24-27 in St Louis, Missouri. The secret game design was revealed in January, and with just six weeks to build, over 2,000 teams created completely unique robots. Design, engineering, metal fabrication, project management, marketing, and fundraising are all activities that students gain exposure to in this real-world project. Most importantly, they practice creative problem solving in complex team dynamics.</p>

<p>The championship teams you may have seen in the Kansas City Regional are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Team 1710 &ndash; The Ravonics Revolution</li>
<li>Team 1730 &ndash; Team Driven</li>
<li>Team 1806 &ndash; S.W.A.T.</li>
<li>Team 1939 &ndash; The Kuh-nig-its</li>
<li>Team 1986 &ndash; Team Titanium</li>
<li>Team 1987 &ndash; Broncobots</li>
<li>Team 3528 &ndash; Up Next!</li>
</ul>


<p>Students are challenged with two software programming components: digital media marketing and robot controls. Students will use a wide range of web, mobile, and media development technologies to create their team&rsquo;s marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Robot controls is broken down into two types: autonomous and teleoperated programs. In autonomous mode the robot responds exclusively to preprogrammed commands based on sensor feedback from a camera, accelerometer, gyro, encoders, and more. In teleoperated mode, the robot continues to use sensors but now can receive input from the drive team using game joysticks.</p>

<p>Students can use three different programming languages for the robot control system:</p>

<ol>
<li>LabVIEW from National Instruments</li>
<li>C++ with Wind River Workbench</li>
<li>Java with Netbeans</li>
</ol>


<p>The most important tool for control system programmers is a white board. Students diagram and visualize all the inputs and outputs of each system: motors, actuators, sensors, and driver station. Mapping inputs to outputs is important not just during the construction of the program, but it also helps to train the drive team. Students use online resources, collaborate with other teams, and receive guidance from their technical mentors. Practicing resourcefulness prepares them for the complex professional engineering environment they will soon become a member of.</p>

<p>Cerner is engaged in the Kansas City community at many levels. We are a sustaining partner in the KC STEM Alliance. Many Cerner associates mentor local teams, volunteer at local events, and are involved parents. These experiences exercise student minds in very real and practical ways. They are more prepared for technical and non-technical Cerner careers. Their passion and commitment is the fuel for delivering our future innovation.</p>

<p>Here is this year’s gameplay video:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most technical problems are like games.  All of them have a way to win and all of them have rules; the easiest way to ensure you always win is to learn the rules inside and out, and more importantly what the rules don’t cover!  Paying attention to what the rules don’t cover is what leads to out of the box thinking.  What sets the great players apart from the rest is learning what the rules don’t cover which allows for creativity and, sometimes, shortcuts.</p>

<p>Recently, I played a game similar to musical chairs. It was a game of diminishing resources (a management exercise) with about 12 of us and six large sheets of paper.  The only rules were: 1) Walk around while the music is playing and 2) Put your foot on a rectangle when the music stopped (he instructor pointed at one of the sheets as a visual queue).  When we first started, there was ample space for each of us to have a foot somewhere on one of the 2’ x 4’ paper.</p>

<p>As the game continued, the instructor started cutting the sheets into smaller and smaller pieces until we got down to 3&#8221; x 5&#8221;.  Most of us were precariously trying to balance and keep a portion of a shoe touching the paper, a few just gave up, and two paid special attention to the rules and found an out.  One gentleman took at a business card and promptly stood on it.  Another just lifted his leg and put it up on the door.  We all were following the same rules but two found what the rules didn’t cover and won.</p>

<p>Most people think that Printing is easy.  You hit a button or Ctrl + P and the paper comes out, right?  This seamless process appears so to users because of the hard work that goes in behind the scenes.  So when I started down this path, I knew a strong foundation would be important. I settled on <a href="http://www.cups.org">CUPS</a> as the basis for my brave new world of printing.  It is open source and has a pretty wide following.  It’s the basis for Apple printing, fairly hardened, and is the backbone of several educational systems printing making it enterprise ready.</p>

<p>The more I worked with it, the more I saw its full potential.  CUPS had turned out to be the most useful &ldquo;Swiss Army Knife&rdquo; in my toolbox.  It is extremely robust and easy to integrate / stack with other solutions.  One great example of this is my &ldquo;Coffee CUPS&rdquo; demo.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" class="aligncenter" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WzEhKs_CvJc?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>I picked CUPS as the underlying backbone for my new architecture for the same reason.  It had the maximum amount of possibilities with the least amount of rules.  With a minimum amount of rules, it allows for the maximum amount of creativity.  Sure, I could develop my own solution from the ground up where I get to make the rules and have unlimited creativity, and I have had to do that in the past.  In general, if you write your own software, you have the least amount of rules (constraints of the compiler).  OpenSource Software is a close second with few limitations.  Closed source 3rd party software usually has the most rules (ever read a EULA in your life?).  When selecting a solution to a problem, it’s also important to do a cost benefit analysis.  Is it really worth reinventing the wheel?  I’m often reminded of the below picture.  I’ve seen several variations of it over the years (Credit to the picture unknown, but it wasn’t me).</p>

<p>CUPS handles a lot of the general architecture that doesn’t need to be re-invented on either end of the spectrum (managing print queues, accepting jobs, sending jobs to printers, etc) but allows for a lot of creativity in the middle (the middle being what is done to the print job in between getting it from the user and sending it to the printer).  A good example of this (filters) can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cups_simple.svg">here</a>.  CUPS gives you an overall framework of how it will call a filter, and what it expects as a return, but beyond that, it’s up to the programmer.  You can write in pretty much any language you want and alter the print job as much as you want.  I leveraged this to maximize the amount of devices I could talk to and input file types I could accept, while also being able to make business decisions based on the content of the print job.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-04-19-learn-what-the-rules-dont-cover/HPRW2.jpg" title="HPRW2" ></p>

<p><em>Source: www.projectcartoon.com</em></p>

<p>I think that picture aptly describes the disconnect in all of the processes that exist in problem solving.  So in addition to learning what the rules don’t cover, we need to be keenly aware of what you are trying to accomplish: what is the problem and the success criteria? How do we win the game?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Cerner&rsquo;s journey with Ruby started in the summer of 2009. We selected Ruby on Rails for rapid development of the <a href="https://store.cerner.com/">Cerner Store</a> to prepare for release at the Cerner Health Conference that year. In three months, with three engineers and a designer, we wrote and released the first version of an e-commerce web application. Two of those engineers, including me, had never worked with Ruby before but quickly realized the power and expressiveness of the language due to resources like <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">Why&rsquo;s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-04-05-ruby-at-cerner/the.foxes-4c.png" title="Chunky bacon!" ></p>

<p>Our experience with the Cerner Store taught us that Rails led to high productivity. Ruby is a very natural language to write code in and principles like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration">convention over configuration</a> enabled us to solve our problems instead of spending time wrangling the framework. In addition, we valued the good practices of the Ruby community like easy-to-understand code and thorough unit testing with tools that aren&rsquo;t painful.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2010, we attended the first <a href="http://rubymidwest.com/">Ruby Midwest</a> as a team. We learned about developments in Ruby like JRuby and Chef as well as some of the great gems under development. The Cerner Store continued to grow and we learned about maintaining a Rails web app over time.</p>

<p>In early 2012, we were planning a massive undertaking to create a new platform for our Clients&#8217; healthcare data. It was to be called Millennium+ and it needed an architecture that could scale well to petabytes of data and dozens of engineers across many teams. We planned a <a href="http://engineering.cerner.com/2013/02/near-real-time-processing-over-hadoop-and-hbase/">service-oriented architecture</a> and chose Rails to serve as the server side of the application. Our Rails services call JVM services that retrieve data from HBase and serves the resulting data as JSON to the client-side applications, including our iOS app, PowerChart Touch Ambulatory. The high productivity we enjoyed on a small team scaled well to a large team of people who had never written Ruby before.</p>

<p>This was the start of Cerner&rsquo;s Ruby community. We developed reusable libraries and development processes that we continue to use today. The complexities of our architecture also led to the adoption of <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> to automate operations and build a devops mindset. Chef is another integral use of Ruby that penetrates teams that did not use Ruby at all.</p>

<p>When planning our newest platform, <a href="http://www.cerner.com/blog/population_health_management_collaboration_with_advocate_physician_partners/">Population Health</a>, we needed to determine which platform made the most sense for a large-scale development of web applications on a tight timeline. We decided on Rails due in large part to its prioritization of convention over configuration, as well as the existing Ruby community at Cerner. These attributes would enable us to develop applications at the planned pace and scale. This decision is now disseminated to dozens of engineers working on brand new web applications and REST services powering them.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve bolstered our internal Ruby community with lots of documentation and guidelines. We make use of the <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">Ruby on Rails Tutorial book</a> and Why&rsquo;s (Poignant) Guide to train engineers in Ruby. Bozhidar Batsov&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide">Ruby style guide</a> aligns closely with how we write our code, so we use <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">rubocop</a> to keep ourselves in line. Our development devices run on <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a> and our servers run on <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/">Phusion Passenger</a>.</p>

<p>Ruby has quickly become a very important part of Cerner&rsquo;s engineering culture, primarily as the language behind Rails and Chef. An internal Ruby meetup has begun and there have been presentations involving Ruby at our annual Developer Conference.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-04-05-ruby-at-cerner/ruby-midwest-logo-2013.png" title="Ruby Midwest 2013 Logo" ></p>

<p>Additionally, we are sponsoring <a href="http://rubymidwest.com/">Ruby Midwest</a> because we want developers to know that Ruby is highly valued at Cerner. We&rsquo;re also sending a large number of our own associates there to learn.</p>

<p>We look forward to bringing on more engineers to use Ruby and other technologies to engineer the future of healthcare.</p>

      </div>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Developers often take for granted the level of flexibility and customization that is available within the software they use every day. Consumers of imaging software have traditionally been completely confined to interpret exams a specific way, and frequently in ways that are unintuitive. Every physician, specialist, technologist, med student, and others across the continuum of care has a preference as to not only how exams are laid out, but what information is displayed with the images and what transformations would be applied or processed automatically. As it turns out, the only workflow they have in common is that they all view exams differently and they all want the experience to be clear and understandable.</p>

<p>We decided to take this to heart in the development of our viewing solution by allowing the application react to the user, opposed to the user reacting to the application and constraining their workflow. Working in the medical community can already be a high stress environment; introducing a piece of software intended to augment patient care that often times makes delivering care more difficult is not a viable solution. Finding the best way to address these issues starts with knowing the solution’s target audience. Before developers can help streamline a workflow, they first have to understand it. If you understand the user’s workflow and how they expect the solution to function, you can design for usability and they will want to use it, as opposed to feeling forced to use it. A key aspect of this is the reliability and simplicity of the application. If the user feels like the application is unstable or overly complex, they will immediately lose interest and view the whole experience as a chore, as opposed to something that can provide value.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-03-29-modularity-in-medical-imaging/Figure-1.png" title="Figure 1" ></p>

<p>The interface is the first application element the user encounters. If it feels intimidating and complex, before they even perform any functions, you have set a negative tone for your application and adoption will be low. In the case of imaging, Radiologists often spend more than 60 hours a week reading over 16,000 procedures per year, all in front of the same application. Imagine working with an application that causes frustration throughout your day.  The first impression can propel an application in the marketplace or stifle it.</p>

<p>With the advent of open source software coming to the forefront, there are a variety of options for developing rich applications backed by a large community of contributors. One of those happens to be the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) and the corresponding Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT). RCP and SWT both provide a way for developers to rapidly develop a professional looking and stable application but are somewhat limiting when viewed from an imaging standpoint. Radiologists typically read on workstations that have three or more monitors and in environments that are dimly lit. Using an application that is primarily grey and white can not only cause eye strain for the user but it can be distracting from what the user is trying to accomplish.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-03-29-modularity-in-medical-imaging/Figure-2.png" title="Figure 2" ></p>

<p>Our team addressed this by starting out with the native components and then closely working with radiologists and visual designers to plan a user interface that was not only visually pleasing but also functional. The end result was a set of skinnable SWT widgets that are reusable within any SWT based application and can be specifically themed to match a desired color scheme for an environment.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-03-29-modularity-in-medical-imaging/Figure-3.png" title="Figure 3" >)</p>

<p>Another aspect of imaging that we needed to plan for was the wide array of uses (diagnostic versus distribution). In a diagnostic scenario, radiologists will use the solution to perform diagnosis and will use the application within a multi-monitor high-resolution environment. For purposes of distribution imaging, clinicians will view images for reference and often times will view these on a much lower resolution single screen device (such as a laptop). While these two scenarios have vastly different hardware environments, users want the same experience across both and do not want to have to learn a new application depending on the workflow they are targeting at the time. As developers, we can address this by using service APIs instead of hard implementations and then create different assemblies that are easily accessible based on what the user is trying to accomplish. This not only helps address production concerns but allows developers to code against mock data sources and stores using the same API that they would within a fully scaled production environment.</p>

<p>Once we had the basics covered, we rethought how we approached the workflow, and sought to intentionally design for usability and responsiveness within the application. Users previously were constrained to grids and a limited amount of information while reading. With modular components designed to perform specific tasks and provide specific information, the user can now decide how they want to consume and view exams.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-03-29-modularity-in-medical-imaging/Figure-4.png" title="Figure 4" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-03-29-modularity-in-medical-imaging/Figure-5.png" title="Figure 5" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2013-03-29-modularity-in-medical-imaging/Figure-6.png" title="Figure 6" ></p>

<p>So now we have a solid application for use within diagnostic scenarios, but how do we give access to the enterprise without adding overhead? Following the path of reuse, we decided that we would use the main application that we already had. By starting with these components instead of rebuilding it for the browser or an entirely new framework, we could focus on how we could change the delivery of that application.</p>

<p>We needed a way to deliver the same high power application without requiring the high power hardware. Traditional IT solutions would use Citrix, VMWare, or some other type of commercially available virtualization solution. While these are all great solutions for certain scenarios, the requirement of plugin installation on the client device accessing the application the heavy graphics processing within an imaging solution does not play nicely in these environments.  We can build on what these other solutions use (MS Remote Desktop Services) but choose to marshal the end result in an entirely different way.</p>

<p>If we want to deliver an application via a web browser, we have a limited selection of tools that we can depend on being available. IE has its own quirks and implementations, Chrome has some fancy extras on top of the WebKit rendering engine, and while Safari/Firefox use the same engine they still behave differently. Developing and deploying an application that must be focused on performance for the end user and still usable within a variety of environments has to take all of these constraints and challenges into consideration.</p>

<p>First, we needed a way to communicate between the client and server. The HTML5 WebSocket API is great for this, but only has minimal support and user adoption. Socket.IO has a great framework that allows for WebSocket emulation (or their native use if available) that provides great performance. We decided to use this for our real-time web app and it has proven to be invaluable throughout our development process.</p>

<p>Now that we can communicate to the server what the user wants to do, we need a way to provide a representation of the images and UI that corresponds to the user input. The HTML5 Canvas API would seem like a good choice but continually redrawing canvas areas is process intensive and as this API isn’t supported within IE (the vast majority of our user base), it simply wasn’t an option. Instead, we decided to use a streaming mechanism, but couldn’t use the HTTP Streaming spec as this inherently introduces latency, which wouldn’t provide an acceptable user experience. All browsers support JPEG and PNG decompression and we can easily compress representations of the screen and shuttle these to the client. Even better, we can do this with a minimal amount of latency (we eliminate the need for key frames within an MPEG stream); we can choose which frames to drop and we can adjust the quality of each frame on the fly. This allows the client to adapt to the current network constraints and machine capabilities by tracking the effective FPS and adjusting the parameters on a sliding scale accordingly.</p>

<p>With all of these tiers in place, we now have an application in the browser that looks identical to the desktop deployment with plugins or installation required.</p>

<p>Beyond that, we have an SDK where third parties can build on top of our current deployment and provide even more specialized functionality within the imaging space, while still allowing users to customize their layout and how the data is delivered. We have now managed to deliver the same application to any device with a browser and our developers can develop from a single code line. This pleases our users and makes our developers’ lives easier. A true testament to how ease of development and a simple, yet powerful, user experience can exist in the same application.</p>
