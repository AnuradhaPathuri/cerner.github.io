  <div class="entry-content"><p>Currently in the world of JavaScript these options
are what we most commonly use to generate logs:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>console.log</code></li>
<li><code>console.info</code></li>
<li><code>console.warn</code></li>
<li><code>console.error</code></li>
</ul>


<p>These are actually pretty good in most modern browsers. Even
if you go back to Internet Explorer 8 <code>console.log</code> and friends
work as long as you have the developer tools open.</p>

<p>Given that we have these logging utilities what is the problem
with using them? When in local development these are just fine
for helping debug and speed up development. They can be used to help
you quickly catch errors or see where you&rsquo;re starting to go astray
when using a library.</p>

<p><code>console.log</code> and friends allow you to see
what&rsquo;s going on and leave notes for other developers in the
future. This is okay for local development. However, what do
you do once you move into production? Almost everyone removes
<code>console</code> commands before code is served in production.</p>

<p>Without console commands in production how do you have the same
level of logging you&rsquo;re used to with standard applications?
When using a web server you get to see most every error that
occurs. Each <code>500</code> is logged to an error log file for every
error that occurs for every user. This is not something that
really exist for JavaScript. By the nature of how web browsers
work we do not get any errors that occur for the end user.</p>

<p>Here are the issues with JavaScript logging today:</p>

<ul>
<li>Local development is the only way to see the errors.</li>
<li>Logs are distributed across many clients.</li>
<li>Errors usually lack local stack context.</li>
<li>We do not know when a user sees an error.</li>
</ul>


<p>Given the problems listed above you may ask: &ldquo;Why should I care?&rdquo;
We&rsquo;ve gotten along for years without getting JavaScript errors.
Try not to follow this line of flawed reasoning. Despite spending years
without tracking analytics about how people use our sites, we
now view those tracking analytics as invaluable. Once you start
seeing your JavaScript errors at the same rate and volume as your
server side errors you will view those logs as invaluable. Most
importantly developers will finally be empowered to provide proactive fixes
for JavaScript errors the same way we can fix server side errors
in a proactive fashion.</p>

<p>Imagine this scenario, you have an advanced search feature in your
application.  This search feature works two fold: it has an
AJAX call to fill out the search results as well as a two-layer UI
with a drop down that shows the results. When a result is clicked, it
opens a more detailed modal of those results.</p>

<p>In most cases this kind of interaction is JavaScript heavy. How
do you know when the searches fail due to a scripting error, instead
of a network drop on the client? What can you do to be proactive
about issues occurring here?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve released a logging framework, <a href="https://github.com/cerner/canadarm/">Canadarm</a>,
to make identifying and handling these kinds of situations
easy. Now each time a script error occurs you&rsquo;ll get to see it. As
long as the client can connect to the Internet and execute JavaScript
you&rsquo;ll get to see what went wrong. A common issue you may not realize
in local testing is a Unicode search error. This logger will tell
you what error occurred as well as the language and encoding used
to read your page.</p>

<p>Below are a some topics that are likely to cross you&rsquo;re mind.
This post will cover each of them in detail.</p>

<ul>
<li>What does Canadarm do?</li>
<li>How does Canadarm work?</li>
<li>Who has used Canadarm?</li>
<li>Has Canadarm helped solve any problems?</li>
<li>When can I use it?</li>
</ul>


<p>This post will cover all of these questions in detail.</p>

<h2>What does Canadarm do?</h2>

<p>Canadarm makes it easy to send logs to a remote server.
This alone is nothing novel and isn&rsquo;t all that impressive. It&rsquo;s fairly easy
to setup a <code>try/catch</code> around your code and send that error to
a server via a <code>GET</code> request. The real advantage to Canadarm comes in
what it does to catch the errors.</p>

<p>Canadarm has three ways to gather errors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatically catch all <code>window.onerror</code> events (least useful due to lack of context)</li>
<li>Automatically catch all errors that occur when events fire (most useful because it &ldquo;just works&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Manually <code>watch</code> or <code>attempt</code> individual function calls</li>
</ul>


<p>These modes allow you to write your code and not have to worry about
logging or catching errors yourself. Any global errors will be caught
and more specifically <em>all</em> errors bound to events will be caught.
The ability to catch errors related to events is the most useful feature of Canadarm.</p>

<p>Most errors that will occur on your web pages happen when a user performs
some sort of action. Canadarm is able to provide you with context specific
error messages by automatically hooking into and monitoring functions
bound to events.</p>

<p>With the <code>Canadarm.watch</code> and <code>Canadarm.attempt</code> functions, you have the power to individually
monitor specific functions. Let&rsquo;s say you have a function that gets
called without an event being fired. You can call <code>attempt</code> on that function which
will immediately invoke the function. If an error occurs, the error will be logged.
With <code>watch</code> you can watch a function once and every time it
throws an error later during execution the error will be logged.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you don&rsquo;t want Canadarm to automatically log global errors
and/or event based errors you can opt-out of this feature. With
<code>watch</code> and <code>attempt</code> you can write your JavaScript how
you want to and not worry about what is going on within Canadarm.</p>

<p>Finally, you get out of Canadarm what you really wanted from <code>console</code> functions.
You can log specific error messages at the point you want to via
these logging commands:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Canadarm.debug(msg, error)</code></li>
<li><code>Canadarm.info(msg, error)</code></li>
<li><code>Canadarm.warn(msg, error)</code></li>
<li><code>Canadarm.error(msg, error)</code></li>
<li><code>Canadarm.fatal(msg, error)</code></li>
</ul>


<p>Optionally, you can provide two more arguments after <code>msg</code> and <code>error</code>. <code>data</code>
followed by <code>options</code>. You can see the usage of these arguments over in the
<a href="https://github.com/cerner/canadarm/">Canadarm documentation</a>. Specifically, <code>data</code> is the most useful
here. <code>data</code> allows you to pass an extra object that will get its values passed
to the appenders. The default appender included in Canadarm will log all these
values for you as key-value pairs.</p>

<p>To find out more on how to configure and use Canadarm go and
check out its <a href="https://github.com/cerner/canadarm/">documentation</a>. It&rsquo;s pretty easy though. You
only need to include the Canadarm code and then configure the logger. As
seen on the Canadarm readme, you can do the following to get a working
local logger:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now you&rsquo;ll see all logged errors in your console with all the information the
standardLogAppender provides. Obviously you want more than local logs. Next you&rsquo;ll
see how our teams have used this logger.</p>

<h2>How does this work?</h2>

<p>Canadarm is fairly simple. The logger catches an error and then
sends that error to a central server. Under the
covers it uses Appenders and Handlers as the mechanisms to achieve
this result.</p>

<h3>Appenders</h3>

<p>An appender works as a way to process an error or log event that occurs.
The appender has this signature: <code>appender(level, exception, message, data)</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>level</code> &ndash; Level of the log, one of <code>DEBUG</code>, <code>INFO</code>, <code>WARN</code>, <code>ERROR</code>, <code>FATAL</code></li>
<li><code>exception</code> &ndash; An actual JavaScript <code>Error</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error">object</a>.</li>
<li><code>message</code> &ndash; Text message of the logged error.</li>
<li><code>data</code> &ndash; Extra information to provide to the appender, usually this is not used.</li>
</ul>


<p>An appender must return an object. The object should contain simple data types.
They are single key/value pairs, usually strings. The return value of
an appender is then passed to a handler.</p>

<h3>Handlers</h3>

<p>Handlers take action on the objects produces by the appenders. A handler&rsquo;s
job is to send the results of the appenders somewhere. By default
there are two handlers that come out of the box with Canadarm:
a <a href="https://github.com/cerner/canadarm/#console-log-handler">console handler</a> that logs all errors
to the console and a <a href="https://github.com/cerner/canadarm/#beacon-log-handler">beacon handler</a> that sends
all errors to a given URL end point.</p>

<h3>Appenders &amp; Handlers</h3>

<p>Appenders and handlers work together to create your logs.
Here&rsquo;s the break down of what happens during an error or logging event:</p>

<ol>
<li>Error or log event happens</li>
<li><em>Every</em> appender is iterated over in order (duplicate keys will be replaced with the value of a later appender)</li>
<li>A final object is created from the output of all appenders</li>
<li>The final object is passed to <em>every</em> handler</li>
<li>Each handler usually sends this information somewhere (e.g. console or remote server)</li>
</ol>


<p>That&rsquo;s it for how the logger works on the client. The real power comes when
you combine this log gathering with the <code><a href="https://github.com/cerner/canadarm/blob/master/lib/handler/beacon.js">BeaconHandler</a></code>.
The logs gathered are then sent to a server. The server receiving these logs should
be writing them out to a file that is then read into a logging system. We currently use a
simple Apache server and treat its access logs as our JavaScript error logs. We then send
the logs to a log aggregation tool, <a href="http://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html">Splunk</a>.</p>

<h2>Who has used it?</h2>

<p>We have a few applications that have begun using Canadarm.</p>

<ul>
<li>HealtheLife &ndash; website for patients to manage their health</li>
<li>Internal Sites &ndash; a few sites we use internally for a few things (e.g. code review, cheat sheets etc.)</li>
</ul>


<h3>HealtheLife</h3>

<p>HealtheLife was the first client facing application to go into production
using Canadarm. They have over 3 million users and at any given moment they
usually have at least one thousand concurrent users. These metrics matter
for two reasons: first, it shows us that Canadarm
works at scale without causing issues to the application, second, we
have been able to see trends in JavaScript errors occurring in this application.</p>

<p>For those who thought &ldquo;why should I care?&rdquo; when it comes to JavaScript logs
this go live was an interesting story. Within the first 20 minutes we
noticed errors that occurred on every page load. Specifically this error
was a reference to <code>$</code> (jQuery) before it was defined. Since this was in
an analytics tracking snippet, and at the end of a script tag, it did not
cause an end user impact, beyond eating processing time to handle an
error on every page.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-07-20-javascript-logging-we-can-do-better/healthe_life_errors.png"></p>

<p>However, it did mean that analytics were not getting tracked how
the application intended. In fact, without this logger in place the
application would have happily continued along with no indication certain actions
where never taking place. Since the analytics tool did not report the
expected user interactions, it appeared as if features of the application
where not getting used, or worse, that the analytics were faulty.</p>

<p>The actual messages in the errors for this application are interesting. Since
HealtheLife is used in many countries with many different
locales, they support various languages. Because of the various
supported languages and users being able to use their browsers in any locale they want, we
had a few interesting logs messages. Specifically we have had a few logs
come across in English, Spanish, German and more. It was kind of eye opening to know that errors are actually
translated within a browser.</p>

<h3>Internal Sites</h3>

<p>Currently a few internal sites are
using Canadarm for local development and integration environments.
Most interesting so far for has been looking at the logs and seeing
who has been copy pasting code around.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough I found some random logs on our Splunk dashboard in dev.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-07-20-javascript-logging-we-can-do-better/logs_for_cheat_sheet_app.png"></p>

<p>Which lead me to github, specifically a github pages site.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-07-20-javascript-logging-we-can-do-better/cheet_sheets_app.png"></p>

<p>Seeing the application and where the logs said the application lived I was able to find the source code.
The code then lead me to the owner of the application. At that point I was able
to contact the owner and get the issue fixed. Finding another application&rsquo;s errors and
letting the owner know about is an interesting experience. The whole interaction was
cool because it was not a use case we had considered when building Canadarm.</p>

<h2>Has it helped solve any problems?</h2>

<p>As mentioned before this has helped to point out two issues:
one for HealtheLife and another for an internal application.
Pointing out issues is not enough to fix them though. Also, Canadarm
does not solve problems on its own. You get the most
out of logging when you use a tool to aggregate those logs. We&rsquo;ve
been using Splunk to aggregate our logs.</p>

<p>Combined with the searching and reporting of Splunk we&rsquo;ve
been able to leverage the logs generated by Canadarm to see
a few common trends in our code. Canadarm has helped
us to see a few common problems we have:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locally we produce a lot of JavaScript errors</li>
<li>We often introduce new errors when we write visualizations</li>
<li>Referencing variables before they exist</li>
<li>New frameworks are hard to get a handle on</li>
</ol>


<p>Using Canadarm to generate logs doesn’t solve problems on it’s own.
It&rsquo;s when we combine those logs with the
reporting capabilities of Splunk that we can see trends and
identify areas we need to improve upon in our development.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-07-20-javascript-logging-we-can-do-better/bar_errors.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-07-20-javascript-logging-we-can-do-better/bar_errors_hover.png"></p>

<p>On our teams it has shown that we need to get better at defining
our APis for data visualizations. I&rsquo;ve been able to see many errors
from our developers when they first try to update or modify any of
our visualizations. Without this logging in place it would not be
so obvious that our current API is not working well for others.
This gives us empirical data that developers are having issues
using our software. Without this data, we&rsquo;d have to rely on complaints
and hope people reported the issues they encountered when using our
code.</p>

<p>As a more concrete example, recently one of our teams has begun to try and use react. By analyzing
the logs it&rsquo;s easy to see that we have had some issues getting a handle
on how react works. Over the few weeks of react work we could clearly
see a number of errors. This shows we need
a lot more training on how to properly use react. Further it shows me
that if we plan to adopt react as our frontend framework that we need
to put together a &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo; or &ldquo;tips and tricks&rdquo; guide for getting
started.</p>

<p>While the logger is not directly &ldquo;solving&rdquo; problems it is helping
to illuminate issues we are seeing in local development as well as
in production. By shining a light on these issues we are able to
move forward and solve these problems ourselves. Sometimes the
problems may be solved by additional training or they may be
solved by code changes. Most importantly Canadarm is opening our
eyes to the kinds of issues we&rsquo;ve had for years with JavaScript. We
can no longer ignore these issue because we have solid empirical evidence
showing us our problems.</p>

<h2>When can I use it?</h2>

<p>After reading along this far hopefully you&rsquo;re thinking: &ldquo;This
all sounds great! When and how can I get started?&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s pretty easy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Include <a href="https://github.com/cerner/canadarm/">Canadarm</a> in your JavaScript (as early as possible)</li>
<li>Configure Canadarm</li>
<li>Have a server to handle logs</li>
<li>Have a reporting tool on top of your logs</li>
</ol>


<h3>Standalone applications</h3>

<p>If you are a public facing Internet application or a small startup,
Canadarm can still be a great investment. Ideally you do not need
to worry about steps 3 and 4 above. Simple Log management solutions,
such as <a href="http://loggly.com">Loggly</a> should be enough for your needs.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what I did to get a quick setup working:</p>

<ol>
<li>Setup a <a href="https://www.loggly.com/signup/">free account</a></li>
<li>Fill out info in the pop up</li>
<li>Go to <code>https://YOUR_SUB_DOMAIN_HERE.loggly.com/sources/setup/https</code></li>
<li>See the &ldquo;step 2&rdquo; section you should have a URL to copy that looks something like:</li>
</ol>


<p>  <a href="http://logs-01.loggly.com/inputs/WWWWWWW-55555-5555555-55WW55-WWWWW55555/tag/http/">http://logs-01.loggly.com/inputs/WWWWWWW-55555-5555555-55WW55-WWWWW55555/tag/http/</a>
5. Configure Canadarm with this end point to see the logs:</p>

<pre><code>Canadarm.init({
  onError: true,
  wrapEvents: true,
  appenders: [
    Canadarm.Appender.standardLogAppender
  ],
  handlers: [
    Canadarm.Handler.beaconLogHandler('http://logs-01.loggly.com/inputs/WWWWWWW-55555-5555555-55WW55-WWWWW55555/tag/http/'),
    Canadarm.Handler.consoleLogHandler
  ]
});
</code></pre>

<p>After this setup it was pretty easy to get some graphs going. For example
you can easily see what errors occurred by message in this pie chart:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-07-20-javascript-logging-we-can-do-better/loggly_pie.png"></p>

<p>Even easier is getting to view the raw output of a given event message:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-07-20-javascript-logging-we-can-do-better/loggly_raw_msg.png"></p>

<p>Loggly is a great tool to use for large and small projects. A big bonus for
anyone starting to use Loggly for their JavaScript logs it that they can
begin to use Loggly for their other logs (if they are not already).
While Loggly may not be ideal for every situation when it comes to logging,
it is really handy when you do not have the resources, money, or time to
setup your own log aggregation tool.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>From desktop, to mobile, to embedded devices, web browsers can be seen
everywhere. With the help of <a href="https://github.com/cerner/canadarm/">Canadarm</a> we can now see
what exactly is happening within our applications. An entire world of
client side errors and issues can now be properly managed and acted
upon. Combine these logs with an aggregation tool such as <a href="http://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html">Splunk</a> or
<a href="http://loggly.com">Loggly</a> and you have enabled operational intelligence.</p>

<p>The next time a user logs an issue for a JavaScript error you can
respond by telling them you&rsquo;ve seen the error and are already working
to correct it. Gone are the days of reactive fixes. Now you can worry
about proactive solutions.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Our team works on a patient facing web application with a thousand live clients with 2,315,000+ users. On an average, the high traffic results into more than 40,000 visits and 300,000 page views daily generating about 30,000 logging events. A considerable portion of these events are of information and warning level in order to aid proactive monitoring or identify potential issues due to clients’ misconfiguration.</p>

<h2>Before Splunk</h2>

<p>To handle this large volume of logging, our team created a rotational support role to manually monitor the logs at regular intervals daily. We built a custom log viewer that would aggregate application logs and the engineer on the support role was expected to watch this tool manually to identify issues. Although we were able to identify problems such as bad client builds or service errors, it was not very efficient nor accurate in quickly determining end user impact stats. Since there was no way to tag previously identified and resolved issues, often times newer support engineers lacked knowledge to react to a problem. This led to unnecessary escalation and engagement of next tier support.</p>

<p><strong>Below: Our old log aggregator used to identify the occurrences (2) of a log with the stack trace.</strong></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-01-29-managing-30000-logging-events-per-day/Log-Aggregator.png"></p>

<h2>Splunk Round 1</h2>

<p>Once we migrated to Splunk we were very excited about the capabilities it offered, especially around searching and data visualization. In addition to searching logs more effectively, we were able to extract meaningful information from our logs unlike before. Splunk gave us the ability to identify client and end user impact down to the user id across all events in our logs [see image below]. This helped us gain more insight into our problems and trends in terms of impact to users. For a particular problem, we were able to quickly conclude whether all clients were affected, whether clients affected were over a virtual network only, and if the issue was isolated to a specific user. This information gave us the ability to determine the impact of issues coming into our logs, including the area of the site being impacted and frequency.</p>

<p><strong>Below: Once we extracted meaningful fields in our logs, we could identify impact. In this case, an issue is spread across 9 orgs and and 28 users.</strong></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-01-29-managing-30000-logging-events-per-day/Selected-Fields.png"></p>

<p>Although we had crossed some of the hurdles which made log monitoring difficult shortly after moving to Splunk, monitoring logs for issues was still not an easy job. It was possible to overlook issues since there was no effective way of studying trends. Initially, we created dashboards which helped identify organizations having problems. This was slightly useful but failed to depict more important graphical representation of the different types of occurring issues for a particular client or for all clients at a given time.</p>

<p><strong>Below: Reports like these weren&rsquo;t very helpful. Clients with more users tend to have more errors, so this trend doesn&rsquo;t necessarily indicate a client is experiencing a downtime.</strong></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-01-29-managing-30000-logging-events-per-day/Report-users.png"></p>

<h2>Splunk Round 2</h2>

<p>It didn&rsquo;t take us long to realize that we had to get a better handle on our logs to stay on top of increasing traffic caused by a growing user base. Although we were able to identify frequently occurring errors, we still needed a more effective way to identify known issues, service issues, configuration issues and application issues. In order to do that, we needed something more meaningful than a stack trace to track issues.  We needed to tag events, and to do that, we turned to the eventtypes feature offered by Splunk.</p>

<p>Eventtypes are applied at search time and allow you to create events to tag search results with. Because they are applied at search time, we were able to add new event types and have them applied historically throughout our logs. This also gave us the ability to tweak our event types to add more known issues as we continued identifying them. Once we successfully gauged a way to take advantage of eventtypes, we came up with a query that created a stacked timechart of eventtypes where eventtypes represented known issues. Once we reached the improved level of production monitoring, the following had to be done:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an eventtype with least priority that catches all problems and label it &ldquo;Unknown Issue.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Go through “Unknown Issues&#8221; and create prioritized eventtypes that describe the problem in english. Once an issue is logged in our bug tracking system, tag the eventtype with that id for easy tracking.</li>
<li>Repeat daily.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Below: Eventtypes give us the ability to see known problems that happen over time. We can even see known problems broken down by client.</strong></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-01-29-managing-30000-logging-events-per-day/Eventtype-1.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-01-29-managing-30000-logging-events-per-day/Eventtype-2.png"></p>

<p>Once we had our frequently occurring problems categorized, we were able to break it down even further. We could identify problems caused by configuration in our application layer, problems that required escalation or if client side contacts needed to be engaged.</p>

<p><strong>Below: We now have the ability to track impact to users from clients not taking a service package [left], or from improper Service Configuration [right].</strong></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-01-29-managing-30000-logging-events-per-day/Impact-to-users-from-clients-1.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2015-01-29-managing-30000-logging-events-per-day/Impact-to-users-from-clients-2.png"></p>

<h3>Alerting</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also started taking advantage of Splunk&rsquo;s alerting. With its powerful searching abilities, we have scheduled searches that trigger an alert when a particular condition is met. For example, when a client has misconfigured certain credentials that cause authentication errors all over the site, we can engage support immediately to get it resolved.</p>

<h2>What&rsquo;s Next?</h2>

<p>Although we have a better understanding of our logs now, it can get even better. We plan on continually categorizing our logs so that monitoring our system becomes really simple for everyone. Once all of our known issues are categorized, we wish to have a scheduled search that can identify anomalies in the logs. This would be highly beneficial to find out if a release introduces issues.</p>

<p>Since our site is dependent on multiple services, most of the service problems are resolved by escalated support. We are currently working on identifying problems with known resolutions  along with  the people that need to be contacted to perform the resolution steps. Eventually we would like to send alerts/emails from Splunk to Cerner’s general support directly for these issues.</p>

<p>We also plan on integrating Jira into splunk with the help of the Splunk Jira app. This will give us the ability to not only track issues in our logs, but also view their current status (investigation, assigned, fixed, resolved). This closes the loop on finding new issues, tracking their impact, and finally their resolution until the end. Splunk has been extremely exciting to work on and has been an invaluable asset to our team. We&rsquo;d love to continue the conversations on how we can improve our usage of Splunk and how others are using it as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Preface</h2>

<p>I have been asked many times what closures are and how they work. There are many resources available to learn this concept, but they are not always clear to everyone. This has led me to put together my own approach to exchanging the information.</p>

<p>I will supply code samples. <code>//&gt;</code> denotes an output or return.</p>

<p>Before discussing closures, it is important to review how functions work in JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Introduction to functions</h2>

<p>If a function does not have a return statement, it will implicitly return undefined, which brings us to the simplest functions.</p>

<h3>Noop</h3>

<p>Noop typically stands for no operation; it takes any parameters, does nothing with them, and returns undefined.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">noop</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{};</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">noop</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;cat&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//&gt; undefined</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Identity</h3>

<p>The identity function takes in a value and returns it.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">identity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">identity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;cat&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">//&gt; &quot;cat&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">identity</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;dog&quot;</span><span class="p">});</span> <span class="c1">//&gt; Object {a: &quot;dog&quot;}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The important thing to note here is that the variable (value) passed in is bound to that function’s scope. This means that it is available to everything inside the function and is unavailable outside of it. There is an exception to this, being that objects are passed by reference which will prove useful with the use of closures and currying.</p>

<h3>Functions that evaluate to functions</h3>

<p>Functions are first class citizens in Javascript, which means that they are objects. Since they are objects, they can take functions as parameters, have methods bound to them,  and even return functions.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">()();</span> <span class="c1">//&gt; true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is a function that returns a function which returns true.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2014-09-29-closures-and-currying-in-javascript/not_sure_if.jpg" title="Not sure if my function or a function from inside my function" ></p>

<p>Functions take arguments and those arguments can be values or reference types, such as functions. If you return a function, it is that function you are returning, not a new one (even though it might have just been made to return).</p>

<h2>Closures</h2>

<p>Creating a closure is nothing more than accessing a variable outside of a function’s scope (using a variable that is neither bound on invocation or defined in the function body).</p>

<p>To elaborate, the parent function’s variables are accessible to the inner function. If the inner function uses its parent’s (or parent’s parent’s and so on) variable(s) then they will persist in memory as long as the accessing functions(s) are still referenceable. In JavaScript, referenceable variables are not garbage collected.</p>

<p>Let’s review the identity function:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">identity</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The value, a, is bound inside of the function and is unavailable outside of it; there is no closure here.  For a closure to be present, there would need to be a function within this function that would access the variable a.</p>

<p>Why is this important?</p>

<ul>
<li>Closures provide a way to associate data with a method that operates on that data.</li>
<li>They enable private variables in a global world.</li>
<li>Many patterns, including the fairly popular <a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html">module pattern</a>, rely on closures to work correctly.</li>
</ul>


<p>Due to these strengths, and many more, closures are used everywhere. Many popular libraries utilize them internally.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2014-09-29-closures-and-currying-in-javascript/closures_everywhere.jpg" title="Closures! Closures everywhere!" ></p>

<p>Let’s take a look at an example of closure in action:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// will log 4 to the console</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The outer function (foo) takes a variable (x), which, which is bound to that function when invoked. When the internal function (bar) is invoked, x (2) and y (2) are added together then logged to the console as 4. Bar is able to access foo&rsquo;s x-variable because bar is created within foo&rsquo;s scope.</p>

<p>The takeaway here is that bar can access foo’s variables because it was created within foo’s scope. A function can access variables in its scope and up the chain to the global scope. It cannot access other function’s scopes that are declared within it or parallel to it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2014-09-29-closures-and-currying-in-javascript/question.jpg" title="Question, does a function inside a function mean you have a closure?" ></p>

<p>No, a function inside of a function doesn&rsquo;t have to reference variables outside of its scope. Recall the example function which returned a function which evaluated to true:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// does something with x or not</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">)();</span> <span class="c1">//&gt; true</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>No matter what is passed to foo, a function that evaluates to true is returned.  A closure only exists when a function accesses a variable(s) outside of its immediate scope.</p>

<p>This leads into an important implication about closures, they enable you to define a dataset once. We’re talking about private variables here.</p>

<p>Without closures, you recreate the data per function call if you want to keep it private.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="kr">private</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// Imaginary large data set - instantiated per invocation</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">private</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">foo</span><span class="p">();</span> <span class="c1">//&gt; [0, 1, 2]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can do better! With a closure, we can save it to a variable that is private, but only instantiated once.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="kr">private</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">];</span> <span class="c1">// Same large imaginary data set - only instantiated once</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// As long as this function exists, it has a reference to the private variable</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kr">private</span><span class="p">);</span>

</span><span class='line'>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By utilizing closure here, our big imaginary data set only has to be created once. Given the way garbage collection (automatic memory freeing) works in JavaScript, the existence of the internal function (which is returned and set to the variable bar) keeps the private variable from being freed and thus available for subsequent calls. This is really advantageous when you consider large data sets that may be created via Ajax requests which have to go over the network.</p>

<h2>Currying</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2014-09-29-closures-and-currying-in-javascript/curry.jpg" title="Mmmm Curry!" ></p>

<p>Currying is the process of transforming a function with many arguments into the same function with less arguments.</p>

<p>That sounds cool, but why would I care about that?</p>

<ul>
<li>Currying can help you make higher order factories.</li>
<li>Currying can help you avoid continuously passing the same variables.</li>
<li>Currying can memorize various things including state.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let’s pretend that we have a function (curry) defined and set onto the function prototype which turns a function into a curried version of itself. Please note, that this is not a built in feature of JavaScript.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">msg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">msg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">msg2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">msg1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39; &#39;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">msg2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;.&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">hello</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">msg</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">curry</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Hello,&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">hello</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Sarah Connor&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span> <span class="c1">// Hello, Sarah Connor. </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">msg</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Goodbye,&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Sarah Connor&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span> <span class="c1">// Goodbye, Sarah Connor. </span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>By currying the msg function so the first variable is cached as “Hello,”, we can call a simpler function, hello, that only requires one variable to be passed. Doesn’t this sound similar to what a closure might be used for?</p>

<p>In the discussion of functional programming concepts, there is often a sense of resistance.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/2014-09-29-closures-and-currying-in-javascript/not_going_to_happen.jpg" title="Stop trying to make functional programming happen. It's not going to happen!" ></p>

<p>The thing is, you’ve probably already been functionally programming all along. If you use jQuery, you certainly already do.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We’ve seen some examples of closures and how they can be useful. We’ve seen what currying is and more importantly that you’ve likely already been functionally programming even if you didn’t realize it. There is a lot more to learn with closures and currying as well as functional programming.</p>

<p>I ask you to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Work with closures and get the hang of them.</li>
<li>Give currying a shot.</li>
<li>Embrace functional programming as an additional tool that you can utilize to enhance your programs and development workflow.</li>
</ol>
