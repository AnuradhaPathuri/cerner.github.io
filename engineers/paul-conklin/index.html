    <h1>Meet: Paul Conklin</h1>
      <h2>Tell us a little about yourself</h2>


<p>I’ve spent my career in Customer Service and Support in some fashion or another. I like to think of myself as an architect/programmer that works from the point of view of the user, not the programmer. I consider something a defect whenever they are allowed to do something they shouldn’t (within reason); if something is working as designed, it doesn’t mean that the design was correct. I enjoy working with my hands, and when I’m not at work, I’m usually doing construction or working on cars. I love taking stuff apart, figuring out how it works, fixing it, and putting it back together again. My car hobby has become so obsessive that I have a shop, dealer account, and car lift. It’s my “therapy” and a nice change of pace to work on stuff you actually can touch versus software and one of those things that’s hard to describe to someone who doesn’t know technology.</p>

<p>“So what have you been doing?”</p>

<p>“Well I’ve been spending the last couple of months developing XYZ.”</p>

<p>“Can I see/touch it?”</p>

<p>“Well, no…”</p>

<p>It can be hard spending your life with the intangible. My wife gave me a coffee mug that sums me up: “Those who say it cannot be done shouldn’t interrupt the people doing it.” Anything is possible; it’s just finding a creative way to accomplish your goal.</p>

<h2>What hardware do you use?</h2>


<p>First and foremost is my Logitech H800. Between it and Pandora, they are probably my most important resources. Past that it’s not anything terribly exciting, just my Lenovo T410 laptop, docking station, Dual 22” monitors, and Wireless Keyboard and Mouse. One of the coolest things I’ve started working with hardware wise is the Mini-box 200 lcd as a stand-alone, plug and play appliance. One of the more exciting things about it is that it is something you can touch. I also have a litany of networking gear from Cisco switches to DualComm Taps and everything in between.</p>

<h2>And what software</h2>


<p>Besides my beloved Pandora, I am an avid user of VMWare. It’s the ultimate in point in time backups. It’s like being able to do rollbacks at any point, so you can get more creative with your decisions. If they don’t work out, you can go back as if you never went down that path. Notepad++ is an invaluable tool. There are so many things in software that can cause erratic results, and they are not in the visible character sets. Notepad++ turns all those non-displaying ASCII characters into something I can see. It’s the same thing with WireShark. I can turn all of those itty bitty packets going over the wire into something I can see. If I can see it, I can follow what it is doing and why (hopefully).</p>

<h2>What would be your dream setup?</h2>


<p>Cray CX1. I don’t know what I would do with it, but I’m sure it would be awesome. That and the video wall setup from Swordfish. The more monitors the better.</p>
