        <h2>FEATURED: Docker for Developers</h2>
        <p>Thanks to Docker, almost every developer can now easily use containers to build, ship, and run any application, anywhere. How does Docker help with those challenges? What does a "Dockerized" development workflow look like?

We will talk about the origins and history of Docker, explain its technical foundations, describe a few use-cases, and spend some time explaining how to use it efficiently to achieve fast, reproducible software deployments. Demos will abound.</p>

        <h2>FEATURED: The Future of Data</h2>
        <p>Doug Cutting, the creator of Hadoop, talks about where he sees the current and future state of big data, the value Hadoop plays in this space, and why it has been so successful. He also discusses the initial use case behind Hadoop that resulted in it's creation.</p>

        <h2>FEATURED: From the Lab to the Factory: Building a Production Machine Learning Infrastructure</h2>
        <p>At most companies, advanced analytics expertise is contained in a lab environment: a small team of analysts sitting at their computers and churning out reports and insights to support business decisions. But the real impact from advanced analytics comes from building models that make real-time decisions within production workflows. We will discuss how to use the ecosystem of technologies around Hadoop to support bringing models out of the lab and into the factory, with a focus on strategies for data integration, large-scale machine learning, and experimentation.</p>
