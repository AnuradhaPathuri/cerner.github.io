    We love solving the hard problems that no one else wants to tackle. We embrace polyglot
programming, distributed systems,and open source. We also know that it’s important to allow
engineers to take a step back and try new things. That’s why we host periodic hackathons,
meetups, tech talks, and an annual internal two-day developers conference in addition to
attending , sponsoring, and speaking at external conferences.

      We attend a lot of <strong>conferences</strong>. As of Nov
2014, we send around 9% of our engineers to
conferences each year. We have also started
sponsoring conferences in order to get
Cerner’s name out in the industry. Cerner
engineers are also getting their talks
accepted at conferences. We feel so strongly
about Cerner engineers speaking at
conferences that if your talk is accepted at a
conference, we’ll pay your way to go!

      <p><strong>DevCon</strong> is Cerner’s internal 2-day
engineering conference. It’s an opportunity
for us to take time off from day-to-day work
and share knowledge, get to know others,
and have fun. In 2014, we had 270+ talk
submissions for just 90 slots, 3000
attendees, and two great keynotes.

Today, <strong>open source</strong> is the core technology
behind many of our architectures and
projects. As of November 2014, Cerner has 5
repositories in our Github organization.
Cerner is also a silver sponsor of the Apache
Software Foundation (higher than Twitter!).
We want to acknowledge our commitment
to open source and support organizations
like the ASF which we benefit from.

Cerner hosts a plethera of internal and external events for engineers to network and learn from
their peers including coderetreats, Hack nights, and meetups in the 8-bit Lounge every week.
These are in addition to a variety of developer centric meetups around the KC area. Some
Cerner-sponsored and some even led by Cerner engineers. Check out our calendar to find out
where you can attend both.
