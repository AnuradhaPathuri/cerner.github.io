        We love solving the hard problems that no one else wants to tackle. We embrace polyglot programming, distributed systems, and open source. We also know that it¹s important to allow engineers to take a step back and try new things. That¹s why we host periodic hackathons, meetups, tech talks, and an annual internal two-day developers conference in addition to attending, sponsoring, and speaking at industry conferences.

          We attend a lot of technology conferences, and we also sponsor conferences to show Cerner's support for the industry. Cerner engineers are getting their talks accepted at conferences like Strange Loop, OSCON, ApacheCon, Midwest.io, and more. We feel so strongly about Cerner engineers speaking at conferences that if your talk is accepted at a conference, we¹ll pay your way to go!

          <p><strong>DevCon</strong> is Cerner¹s internal two-day conference for associates across all roles in development. It¹s an opportunity for us to take time off from day-to-day work and share knowledge, get to know others, and have fun. In 2015, we had 90 talks, 3,100 attendees, and two keynotes.

    Today, <strong>open source</strong> is the core technology behind many of our architectures and projects. Cerner is a silver sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation. We want to acknowledge our commitment to open source and support organizations like the ASF, which we benefit from.
