{% engineer about %}

I'm a Software Engineer helping to craft the face of web applications across Cerner's Healthe Intent Platform, the foundation for Cerner's Population Health solutions. I've been with Cerner for about 1.5 years and have worked on both the Score Cards solution as well as Blue Steel. Alongside my engineering role I act as a mentor for new hires and teach JavaScript to associates from many teams and roles across Cerner.

Outside of work I enjoy traveling, video games, music, movies, and playing several musical instruments (clarinet, flute, oboe, ocarina, sax). I also love parrots and have a cockatiel as well as a Hahn's macaw; I hope to one day have a Hyacinth macaw or a Toucan.

15" MacBook Pro Retina Display, iPhone 6 Plus, Raspberry Pi, and a red Built breathable backpack (looks like a life vest). I also have a 3-drawer cabinet full of random tools, devices, and far too many cables.

For coding, I almost always use Sublime Text, but don't hesitate to hop on VIM depending on the situation. For source control I use git and wouldn't have it any other way. I use Chrome as my primary browser, but since I develop front-end applications I use them all on a fairly regular basis. I use JSHint all the time; I even have it running in Sublime for real time goodness. For writing markdown I use Markdown Pro since it lets me see it parsed as I type it.

Outside of work I also use Atom for editing as well as Node to run all the things.

I really enjoy tinkering with various devices, such as the leap motion, so I wouldn't mind having devices I could program for (preferably with JavaScript) and mess with, a nice 15" or 17" MacBook Pro, fiber optic internet, a couple external monitors (both portrait and landscape), and a personal espresso maker would pretty much be amazing!

I don't think I could ever have too many gadgets to play with.
