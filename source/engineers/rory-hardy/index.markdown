{% engineer about %}

I'm a Software Engineer helping craft the face of web applications across Cerner's Healthe Intent Platform, the foundation for Cerner's Population Health solutions. As well as creating consistent looking web applications, I've been helping to bridge the gap between Engineering and User Experience to enhance development across Cerner. I've been with Cerner for about one and a half years and have worked on both the scorecards capability of Healthe Registries as well as Blue Steel.

I'm active in the web development community within Cerner, running the web developers meet-up, mentoring new associates in best practices in the Academy program, and creating JavaScript courses and content for many associates across Cerner.

Outside of work I enjoy traveling, video games, music, movies, and playing several musical instruments (clarinet, flute, oboe, ocarina, sax). I also love parrots and have a cockatiel as well as a Hahn's Macaw; I hope to one day have a Hyacinth Macaw or a toucan.

{% engineer hardware %}

* 15" MacBook Pro Retina Display
* iPhone 6 Plus
* Raspberry Pi
* Leap Motion
* red Built breathable backpack (looks like a life vest)
* 3-drawer cabinet full of random tools, devices, and far too many cables

I almost always use Sublime Text for coding, but don't hesitate to hop on Vim depending on the situation. Git is my preferred choice for source control. I use Chrome as my primary browser, but since I develop front-end applications I use them all on a fairly regular basis. I use JSHint all the time; I even have it running in Sublime for real time goodness. I look to Markdown Pro to handle writing Markdown since it allows me to view a parsed and formatted version along side my code in real time.

Outside of work I also use Atom for editing as well as Node to run all the things.

{% engineer dream %}

I really enjoy tinkering with various devices so I wouldn't mind having more devices I could program for (preferably with JavaScript) and mess with.

The following would be amazing:

* a nice 15" or 17" MacBook Pro
* fiber optic internet
* a couple external monitors (both portrait and landscape)
* a personal espresso maker

I don't think I could ever have too many gadgets to play with.
