{% engineer about %}

I am a Sr. Software Architect working on Cerner's Big Data team.  We are an infrastructure team focused heavily on research and finding the correct way to solve a problem.  Over the course of my career I have worked developing custom UI components for rich desktop applications, creating reusable assets, and highly scalable ReST services.  Over the last few years I've been focusing on all things Big Data helping to use technologies such as Hadoop, HBase, and Storm as an efficient batch and real time processing platform for Cerner's Millennium+ and Population Health solutions.
 
When I'm not at work I'm usually trying to learn everything that I can about anything.  I also generally try to consume entertainment in the form of comics (web, books, and strips), fantasy novels, and movies of all types.  I hate running but friendly peer pressure and the urge to be healthier has cause me to take it up as a hobby.

{% engineer hardware %}

I currently do most of my work on a 17" MBP with 16 GB of RAM.  The RAM is a necessity as I'm constantly building while running a full Hadoop/HBase stack which makes the machine work.  I have an additional 24" monitor I use occasionally but mostly work without to try and cut down on the distractions.  
 
At home I'm usually hacking on my 13" MBP or reading on an iPad.

On good days I'm spending most of my time coding which usually means I'm splitting my time between an IDE and the terminal.  I tend to bounce between IntelliJ and Eclipse enjoying the benefits of each and grumbling at their shortcomings.  I do my quick editing in vim or Sublime Text 2 though I'm starting to use Emacs more and more.  Vagrant is also great for quickly setting up a new VM for testing and never having to leave the terminal.
 
Aside from tools for development, I generally am looking to use the simplest and lightest tools possible to get the job done.  Currently using Mail.app, iCal, Chrome, Limechat, Spotify and Evernote but would be interested in suggestions.

{% engineer dream %}

Dream setup would be the best MBP I can buy with as much memory as possible.  Aside from the device, somewhere with a decent sound system and a good view would be great.  Last request would be a desk with enough room for my cat to lie near me.  He likes to lay between myself and the screen to "sleep" but really I know he is critiquing my code.
