{% engineer about %}

I joined Cerner after graduating from Evangel University with degrees in computer science and digital arts in 2013. About the same time I started at Cerner, I got married to my beautiful wife Carrie and we have been living the nerd dream ever since. Outside of work I dabble in videography/photography as well as musical interests. My favorite instrument is the piano, but recently at renfest we picked up an ocarina so my "favorite instrument" may be changing soon given that I can play the song of storms on it and totally geek out.

{% engineer hardware %}

I have a Lumia Icon (yes, I am a windows phone hipster), but only because the Nokia n900 was the single greatest piece of tech I have ever owned and I wanted to stay in the Nokia family. For work, I use a Macbook and at home I have a wicked old laptop running Xubuntu and a shiny new desktop running Win10. For photos/video I use a Canon 5D Mark II with Magic Lantern installed.

{% engineer software %}

- MacVim (with countless plugins), Firefox, iTerm, Git
- Vagrant, Docker, Test Kitchen, Chef

{% engineer dream %}

My current dream is living somewhere out closer to nature, the one downside to this is I checked with Google and I don't think they are planning to turn nature into a fiberhood anytime soon.
