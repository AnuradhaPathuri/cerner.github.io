{% engineer about %}

Having graduated just four years ago, I still consider myself a newbie to the design profession with a lot to learn. Luckily I've had the honor of working beside some amazing designers who have already taught me so much about what we do and how to make it better.

I went to the Cleveland Institute of Art, studied abroad in London, and worked in a small marketing agency before coming aboard the Cerner ship. Mainly, I get to work on the patient-facing websites that are quickly making their way out to the wild, so it's been a really fun transition from whiteboard to code.

I enjoy long walks on the beach, candlelit dinners...

{% engineer hardware %}

I use a 15" MacBook Pro running Mountain Lion that is currently hooked up to an external 22" Dell monitor (I keep my Illustrator tool bar on that so it doesn't crowd my laptop screen). I'm also using an old-school plug-in mouse with a roll ball (I can't stand using the track pad for design work).

I use Creative Suite 6, working primarily in Illustrator. There is an ongoing debate between design teams about whether Illustrator or Fireworks is better to use for web interfaces, and while both schools of thought have great arguments, it always comes down to working with what you're comfortable in. I've been using Illustrator exclusively for the past seven years, and I can crank out 10 iterations in the same time it would take me to move a box a few pixels in Fireworks. While it may take a little longer to mark-up styling and dimensions in Illustrator, we work with such amazing developers that they only need a few cues to match it to the design.

{% engineer dream %}

I get the most work done when I can sit in front of the TV and watch hours of Netflix, so embarrassingly enough, my dream setup is my living room couch. In a perfect world, I'd be able to keep my external monitor hooked up, along with my mouse, so I suppose a desk would need to be involved somehow. But as long as I have a movie on, I'm a happy designer.
