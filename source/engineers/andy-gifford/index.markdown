{% engineer about %}

I'm a Lead Architect on the iAware development team, leading projects focused on building and enhancing the iAware platform (an application framework built on top of Eclipse RCP). I began at Cerner in 2005 working first with the Nursing Development team developing in C++ and in 2007 became part of the team that would become iAware.
 
Most of my free time away from work is devoted to my family, sports and television. My wife and I welcomed a son last year and I love playing with him and watching him grow. I'm a (somewhat) avid runner and enjoy almost any sport from both a participation and viewer perspective.

{% engineer hardware %}

All of my development is done on Windows devices. At work I use a Lenovo laptop with three 24' monitors and at home I have a custom built Windows PC.
 
I also have an iPad, Samsung Galaxy Nexus SIII, Xbox 360 and a couple of Samsung HDTVs.

{% engineer software %}

Eclipse and supporting solutions including Crucible, Bugzilla/JIRA and Jenkins. I also use Beyond Compare, iTunes, Notepad++, 1Password and a whole host of online applications.

{% engineer dream %}

I'm happy with my current setups but I would take a faster processor and more RAM in my work device and a faster internet connection at home.
