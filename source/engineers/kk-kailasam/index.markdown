{% engineer about %}

I am a software engineer in Cerner’s Decision Support organization designing and implementing solutions that provide cross venue care. Our solution suite includes data transformation services, clinical ontologies, and software agents to implement Cerner Math developed models that predict outcomes. The transformation services handle large volumes of data in a Big Data environment, process unstructured clinical documentation using natural language processing techniques, and link persons [RecordLinkage] across data sources. The Ontology services enable specification of a clinical program in a consistent and standards based approach. The software agents use the data transformation services and clinical ontologies to execute mathematical models and predict outcomes such as hospital readmissions, suicide risk score, etc. In the past, I have developed rich client solutions and APIs in C++ and Java.

{% engineer hardware %}

For most of my hardcore development activities, I use a 32 GB Linux desktop. I use a Windows laptop for office-related tasks at work. At home, I have a couple of Mac devices (a MBP and an iMac). Unfortunately, one item on my Christmas wish list – a Cray XK7 supercomputer – did not find its way to my house. Alas, there’s always next year.

{% engineer software %}

Eclipse and REvoIDE [R programming] are the ones I use most when in development mode. Most of my development is focused on studying and implementing mathematical models and algorithms using packages in R [http://cran.r-project.org/] and Weka [http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/].

{% engineer dream %}

My dream is to always operate in a startup mode without any boundaries, and for the last few years, I have been living this dream. For the last few years, we have been operating from an offsite location. My team has been doing cutting-edge work that has delivered important services to many teams. Our work is strategically important to Cerner.
