{% engineer about %}

Professionally I plan, decompose, draw pictures of, and support building our applications. I've grown up in Cerner Engineering and watched our culture flourish. Personally, I enjoy being a father and husband. In the community I participate in many FIRST Robotics activities. For hobbies, I suppose learning new things is a lot of fun!

{% engineer hardware %}

Work gear is a late 2011 - 17" Macbook Pro + 16 GB RAM and a pair of 24" LCDs. Home gear is a hand built PC with components that are so powerful, wired up to as many monitors or TVs as I have power outlets and video adapters to support. On-the-go gear or couch gear is a Nokia 920 or Nexus 7.

{% engineer software %}

Eclipse, Terminal, Office, Chrome, Xcode, Limechat, Sourcetree

{% engineer dream %}

Curved OLED screens are going to be sweet. I look forward to high-speed high-precision input alternatives to keyboards and mice.
