{% engineer about %}

I am project manager, scrummaster, and software architect for the DevCenter. As of 2013, I’ve been a Cerner associate for a total of 7 years working on things ranging from physician documentation workflow to data mining medical record data for adverse reactions. Several years back, I took a 5 year hiatus from Cerner to work on a local navigation company’s algorithms for shortest pathfinding, spatial searching, and domain-specific compression. I returned to Cerner in 2012 as an instructor for the early career software engineer training program. While in that role, I helped create DevAcademy.

I see myself as more of a math geek than a computer geek, so I tend to fall in love with problems more than technologies or languages. In the last 3 years, due to the shortage of engineers, I’ve been spending more and more time thinking about recruiting and talent development. To me, it’s the biggest problem facing the industry and the biggest obstacle to accomplishing any great idea. Outside of my family, my favorite things are monkeys, good beer, and brunch.

As part of my job, I have to jump around a lot. I spend most of my time on a Lenovo w530, but I also play around on a MacBook Air for Ruby development.

Again, I jump around a lot. For C++/C#, I use Visual Studio. For Java, it’s mostly Eclipse. For all other languages, Notepad++. For source code management, it’s git. The thing I probably have open more often than anything else is Excel. I love data, and I hate making decisions without having analyzed all the input. (This usually involves writing a quick Python script to get the data into the format I need to be able to play with it in Excel.)

{% engineer dream %}

I want all the machines! Over my career, I have had a tendency to collect devices of different operating systems and architectures. Right now I have my needs met on Windows and iOS, so I could use a Linux box. I wouldn’t mind an Android tablet. I could always use a couple of extra monitors.
