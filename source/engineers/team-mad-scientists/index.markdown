{% engineer about %}

**Alex Valentine**: I’m an intern here at Cerner. I’ve been working on the Mobile E-Signature Solution this summer. I am going to be a senior at KU this upcoming semester, and I’m looking to graduate this Spring. In my free time I like to spend time with friends and play lots of video games.

**Jack Miles**: I'm a senior at the University of Kansas studying journalism, computer science and Japanese. This summer, as a software engineer intern at Cerner, I've been helping develop iPad applications for the RevWorks Mobile team. In my spare time, I'm often running, biking, playing piano or carillon, or trying to learn more about web development. I enjoy etymology and trivia, and I strive to know a little bit about everything.

**George Li**: I am a senior at the University of Kansas studying computer science. I will be graduating this December. I enjoy about the latest trends in technology whether it’s a new programming language, source control tool, or the latest gadget that’s being announced. I also enjoy playing video games during my free time.

**Alex Valentine**: I use the standard intern windows machine, The Lenovo T410, for development here at Cerner. At home I have a Toshiba Satellite Laptop that I got from my parents for High School graduation, so nothing super fancy but it does what I need.

**Jack Miles**: At work, I'm using a 17" MacBook Pro and a Samsung external monitor. I also use a few iPads for running the applications I'm working on. At home, I split my time between my Linux laptop, an old PowerBook G4 used mostly for Adobe Creative Suite (version 1!), a desktop computer I built a couple years ago, and my Canon 20D (usually with a 24-70mm f/2.8 L lens).

**George Li**: Work: Lenovo Thinkpad T410; Home: Lenovo Thinkpad E420 with 250 GB SSD and 160 GB secondary drive (instead of a CD drive), 24” Asus Monitor; Mobile: Samsung Galaxy S III running Android 4.1.2 Jellybean

{% engineer software %}

**Alex Valentine**: I’ve been doing a lot of C# and Java development this summer, which has been a lot of fun and a great learning experience for me, so I’ve been using a lot of Eclipse and Visual Studio. And the Unity game engine if you want to include Hack Fest in this list.

**Jack Miles**: Most of my time is spent in Xcode writing Objective-C, or in the iOS Simulator checking out the code I just wrote. Aside from those, I'm mostly using other text editors (usually Vim or Sublime Text), or doing cross-browser testing across my three computers and phone.

**George Li**: Mozilla Firefox, Spotify, Google Play, Emacs, Visual Studio 2010 and 2012, Windows 7/8, Fedora 18

**Alex Valentine**: Anything with the latest and greatest Intel Processor and an SSD. I’m really into SSD’s right now because they are super-fast and my computer at home has terrible boot times.

**Jack Miles**: A hammock, somewhere.

**George Li**: I’m actually wanting to switch over to a Mac and I would like a 13-inch Macbook Pro with a Intel Haswell chip so I am still waiting for the next Apple announcement. I think the push to switch was mainly motivated by the fact that a lot of tools for web development are made for Unix-like system and are a bit harder to get to work on Windows. Plus I’m not very fond of Windows 8 right now and I’m skeptical that 8.1 will “fix” anything. The 13-inch for easy portability and I would definitely like a 24 - 27” monitor for working purposes.
