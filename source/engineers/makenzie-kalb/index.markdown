{% engineer about %}

Iâ€™m a senior at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, studying biomedical engineering and computer science with a focus in medical imaging. This summer, as a software engineer intern, I have been developing a desktop application for Associate Support. In my free time, I enjoy reading and being active outdoors: running, biking, canoeing, backpacking.

{% engineer hardware %}

At work I have been using a Lenovo T410 for development. At school, I have a 13 inch MacBook Pro.

{% engineer software %}

For my project, most of my time is spent writing java in Eclipse. I also spent some time writing Windows PowerShell scripts. For the HackFest, I did most of the UI using Adobe Photoshop.

{% engineer dream %}

Probably a MacBook Air for easy portability with some high resolution displays. Also, a big window nearby would be nice.
