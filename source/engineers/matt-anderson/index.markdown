{% engineer about %}

I’ve always considered myself a better visual communicator than a verbal one. That being said, I actually really enjoy public speaking. I’ve been an interaction designer at Cerner since 2011, and have had experience designing user-centered interfaces for iOS, Java, HTML & Win32. One of my favorite parts of the design process is the collaborative process between designer & engineer — it’s the part where the ideas come to life, and I find that really inspiring. I see design as an immersive and emotional experience, which fuels my passion for animation and subtle refinement. I am an avid typographic nerd, and as a token of my art school years, I really enjoy art history.

{% engineer hardware %}

At my desk, my setup includes a 17” MacBook Pro plugged into a 27” Apple Thunderbolt Display. You’ll seldom find me without at least four devices within reach. Since I primary design for iOS, I’ve been trying to consciously constrain myself to working exclusively with the tablet and mobile device in tandem. More on that later.

{% engineer software %}

Most of my work involves Adobe Fireworks (RIP), Keynote & Xcode. But to be honest, I use the iPad as my primary device for sketching out and presenting ideas. I strongly believe that ideas begin organically, and I see design as a very organic process. 

{% engineer dream %}

I don’t know. Can I get another display? And maybe a solid state MacBook Pro. I see the ideal workplace as a studio with lots of open space for critique and collaboration.
