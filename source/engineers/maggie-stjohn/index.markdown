{% engineer about %}

I’m a system engineer within the CernerWorks team. I’ve been on the remote hosting side of things for going on nine years now. I started out specializing in front end production management – mostly Windows Citrix servers and the various Millennium applications that would be installed on them. After a few years, I switched to the back end project implementation space and found my niche. I love planning things! Being slightly OCD is a good thing in certain circumstances.

In my non-working time, I play roller derby. It gets all the frustration and angst out in a nice, healthy, though sometimes painful, way. I’m a bit addicted.

{% engineer hardware %}

Well, my day to day operations all happen from my laptop or my iPhone. I don’t know how I got anything done without my phone. From my laptop I connect to lots of other hardware though. I’ve worked on VMS, AIX, HP-UX, and Linux nodes. These nodes are massive! They are usually running upwards of 10 processors with 50 to 500gb of memory. The glory of technology in this decade is that we don’t actually have to hook a console up to do the majority of our work. I’m not really that into hardware. I just want it to run smoothly and not run out of CPU or memory.

{% engineer software %}

Microsoft Word is honestly my medium of choice. I write a lot of processes and procedures. I try to take all of the bits of information being thrown at SE’s on a day-to-day basis, combine and consolidate it into a process that is easy to follow, with the smallest margin of error possible. Word and Excel are my best friends. It doesn’t matter what OS you are running. You can always get the appropriate viewer and access all the gems of wisdom in my documents.

{% engineer dream %}

My dream setup is at home on my couch, with a couple of dogs snuggled up and pinning me there. I have my gaming PC hooked up to a 55” LCD LED TV, along with a smaller 27” monitor. When working from home, I’ll have the TV tuned to Nat Geo or something, and then will have my applications viewable on the monitor. With my keyboard on my lap, and a small table for the mouse to set on, it’s a perfectly comfortable and productive way to work. I’ll usually also have the laptop powered up and sitting beside me for those applications that I can’t run remotely.
