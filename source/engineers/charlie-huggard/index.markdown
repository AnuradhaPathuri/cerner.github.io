{% engineer about %}

You’d know my cube by the pile of Domo-kuns, the Lava Lamp, the Companion Cube Fuzzy Dice, and many other trinkets. I am on Twitter at [@acharlieh](http://twitter.com/acharlieh) and often tweet about tasty bacon.

I’ve been with Cerner since 2004 but full-time after getting my Masters from Mizzou in 2008. In that time I’ve worked on teams ranging from Supply Chain to iAware Platform.

{% engineer dream %}

My dream setup is at home, in my recliner, two laptops and all devices nearby, with Netflix on my TV, plenty of chocolate, Coke, and other snacks within reach.
