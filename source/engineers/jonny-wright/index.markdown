{% engineer about %}

I'm a software engineer at Cerner. I have a thing for OSGi development - but recently have begun exploration into Hadoop, HBase and large data transformations. I've spent the past 5+ years (last year of college and all my Cerner career) working on Eclipse RCP applications as well as the iAware platform (built on top of Eclipse). I've recently moved to the Population Health team, working on the infrastructure.

Outside of working, I like to do gaming, read about economics and politics, visit all the restaurants I can find around the KC area, and attend Sporting KC games. I have a thing for travelling on the side.

{% engineer hardware %}

My hardware consumption pretty much spans the gamut. For work I use a Core i7, 8GB RAM, 17" macbook pro. At home I use a Shuttle PC with a Core i7, 32GB of RAM, 2 256 SSDs that dual boots Windows 8 and Ubuntu hooked up to a 28" monitor.

I'm also a bit of an Android junkie and have a Nexus 4, Nexus 7 and Asus Transformer.

{% engineer software %}

For most of my development I use Eclipse, but I've made the occasional foray into the Scala IDE. I split my development time between MacOS X, Ubuntu and Windows 8. I also do some Android development when I'm feeling the itch.

Other than that I mostly do almost everything I can through Chrome, whether that be chat, email, whatever. Besides Chrome I accomplish most things through the terminal (such as git, ssh, hadoop job execution).

{% engineer dream %}

I don't know - my shuttle is pretty good. Maybe a more comfortable chair.
