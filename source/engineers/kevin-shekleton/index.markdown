{% engineer about %}

I'm a Distinguished Engineer and have been at Cerner since 2002. I'm currently responsible for our cloud/mobile applications, the latest of which is our Ambulatory iOS app. So, I get to help drive the architecture of our latest and greatest apps. It's a blast. Over the past few years I've also been involved in the planning and execution of our internal developers conference.

Prior to this, I've worked on core backend services (C/C++), RESTful services (Java), and our search services around the medical record.

Outside of work, you can find me picking up some comic books (trying to get a complete Uncanny X-men run), playing classic video games, or tinkering around with electronics (my latest hobby). I have an unofficial (still needs to be verified) world record in Oil's Well for the ColecoVision.

Most of my development is done on a 17" Macbook Pro (8GB of RAM) with a 28" external monitor. As I'm involved with iOS development these days, I also have several iOS devices that I use daily for development as well. I also have a 28" iMac (also 8GB of RAM) that I use when hacking away at home.

I'm all in with Apple so I use the Apple Magic Mouse and Apple wired keyboards with numpads on both setups. I prefer those to the wireless keyboards (I have a thing about having full-sized arrow keys).

I have a pair of Audio-Technica ATHANC7 noise canceling (active) headphones that I use to blast music during the day.

And at home, I've been playing around with my Arduino and Snap Circuits with my son.

I spend most of my day hacking in Sublime Text and Xcode. The rest of my development is rounded out by Kaleidoscope, Charles Proxy, and Tower (just for large merges).

Our team uses IRC for communication so Textual is always running. Other miscellaneous tools I use throughout the day are Alfred, Evernote, 1Password, Dropbox, OmniGraffle, Things, and Time Sink.

And, throughout the day, I've got Spotify cranked through my headphones. :)

The latest and greatest Macbook Pro (upon each release) with dual 30" monitors and a completely uninterrupted day for focused coding.
