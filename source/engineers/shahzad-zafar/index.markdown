{% engineer about %}

I started at Cerner in 2005 after graduating from University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My first experience was developing C++ backend services for Millennium. Later, I also worked on java services for Millennium. I switched roles to become a Technical Project Manager in 2009 and also completed my MBA from the University of Kansas in 2009. Since then, I have been leading multiple teams developing using Agile methodologies. Currently, I am the project manager for our Millennium+ Cloud services, which involves working with platform core and user capability projects, as well as collaborating with our Ops teams to create a culture of DevOps and facilitating deployments of code all the way into production.

{% engineer hardware %}

I use a Lenovo T420 with Windows 7 and an external monitor. At home, I have a MacBook Pro, Apple TV and an iPad, which makes it easier to project on to HD TV from the laptop or iPad for work or just to watch movies.

{% engineer software %}

I use Git Bash, Oracle VM VirtualBox, SQL Developer for connecting to the database for troubleshooting and Eclipse and Notepad++ for messing around with code. Since most of our teams use JIRA, I spend quite a bit of time in JIRAâ€™s projects and Agile boards for managing the projects and tasks.

{% engineer dream %}

Dual monitor, with a machine with a faster processer and RAM, having Google Fiber at home and an easy way to wirelessly project on a wall or screen.  Unlimited supply of Parisi coffee would be nice to have as well.
