{% engineer about %}

I'm a developer that likes to make development easier. I like to create tools that speed up development time and make it easier to get to the real problems we are trying to solve. I can be seen on the Internet as garrypolley on most websites. I'm always happy to lend a helping hand.  Feel free to reach out to me:

{% engineer hardware %}

Currently I use a 15 inch mac book pro for my day-to-day work. I also love to listen to music when I work. At home I use the [Sennheiser HD 598](http://en-us.sennheiser.com/audio-headphones-high-end-surround-sound-hd-598) headphones. To be kind to my coworkers I use the [Sennheiser Momentum Red](http://en-us.sennheiser.com/over-ear-headphone-momentum-stereo). These are pretty great if you love to listen to more accoustic style music. They are both less base heavy, which I prefer and wholeheartedly recommend.

{% engineer software %}

The best editor you can use is Sublime Text. I'm currently using version 3 of Sublime Text. When I need to run code I open up a terminal and run the application. I am a big fan of separating the writing and running of code.

Other software I like to use: Final Fantasy VII, Civilization V, Rock Smith, and Trello.

{% engineer dream %}

One day I hope to live in a world where computers solve most problems automatically. Also, I want unlimited home made ice cream.
