{% engineer about %}

I started at Cerner in 2005 after graduating from Purdue University. In the beginning, I worked on C++ backend services for our Millennium system.  From there, I began working on Java and RESTful web services. I am currently focused on our Millennium+ cloud platform services, which involves working with different serialization technologies, HBase, and automating any operational aspect of our services. Last year, I finished my Master's degree at the University of Kansas.

{% engineer hardware %}

Most of my time is spent on a MacBook Pro (17-inch) with 8 GB of RAM. In my spare time, I've been playing around with Raspberry Pis and BeagleBone Black boards.

{% engineer software %}

Eclipse (however, starting to transition to IntelliJ for Scala development), Sublime Text 2 for most other things (Ruby, Python, bash scripts), and whatever I can script in the bash terminal.

{% engineer dream %}

Patio with adequate shading, cool breeze, laptop with blazing fast network speeds, and an unlimited supply of Americano style coffee.
