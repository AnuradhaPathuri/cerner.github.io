{% engineer about %}

I lead the software development side of Cerner's Medical Informatics Institute, a small and experienced research team focused on solving problems at the intersection of medicine and software. We try to look ahead and outside Cerner's mainstream solution lines, and find ways to connect ideas and bring those innovations back into the fold. Over the last decade in collaboration with many teams within Cerner, we've contributed code, insights and solutions in areas including semantic search, community e-prescribing, collaboration technologies, among many others.

This past year, when I'm not hacking around with machine learning improvements for our clinical solutions including chart search, I've been involved in a couple of Cerner's K-12 outreach programs, including contributing curriculum to the new Project Lead the Way computer science course being piloted across the country during the 2013-14 school year.

{% engineer hardware %}

Daily work: a 17" MacBook Pro with 16GB of aftermarket RAM. Periodic work: a small Hadoop research cluster for scaling up mapreduce jobs. At home: a bunch of Apple stuff including a 27" iMac, a 15" MacBook Pro, and an iPad.

{% engineer software %}

At work: TextMate, NumPy/SciPy/nltk with Python, R, NetLogo for playing around with simulations, FreeMind for brainstorming, Pig and Hadoop for big data hacking, and occasionally Eclipse/Java. At home: Literature and Latte's Scrivener for writing projects, and Kerbal Space Program for fun.

{% engineer dream %}

I've never really had a fetish for needing to have the latest and greatest hardware, but big and bright monitors are sweet. I tend to need a balance of analog and digital, so awesome notebooks, graph paper, and pens are important at certain stages of thinking and development. There's a lot of room to think when you're faced with a blank white page, and the friction from writing things down lets ideas run in more interesting and insightful ways compared to just jumping into an IDE or mind mapping tool. So I guess my dream setup would be a room lit by ambient monitor glow from late model OS X gear, a big stack of paper to run through ideas, and a pen that makes smooth lines and never runs out of ink.
