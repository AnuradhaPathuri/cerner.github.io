{% engineer about %}

I'm a Distinguished Engineer and the Principal Architect for the Healthe Intent Platform, the foundation for Cerner's Population Health solutions. I've been with Cerner over 14 years and have worked on a number of solutions, including MillenniumObjects and the [Cerner Store](https://store.cerner.com/). I'm also a member of the [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/).

Outside of work, my passion is the consumption of popular culture artifacts and experiences: movies, televison, music, comics, books, video games, memes and art.

{% engineer hardware %}

Several Macs (15" MacBook Pro Retina Display, 13" MacBook Air and an 21" iMac), iPhone 4S, iPad Air and a Mission Workshop AP Series VX Sanction backpack.

Most frequently, I use the following: Chrome, TextMate, 1Password, Things and IRB.

A maxed out 15" MacBook Pro, a light & sturdy backpack and a coffee shop with fiber-speed WiFi.
