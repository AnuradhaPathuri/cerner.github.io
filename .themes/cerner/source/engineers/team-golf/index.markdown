{% engineer about %}

**Addison Shaw**: I’m a Computer Science major at K-State. I’ve been interning at Cerner for 3 summers now, so I’m pretty used to being thrown in new environments and carrying my desk along on my back. I love experimenting with new technologies and I live for deadlifting.

**Richard Habeeb**: During the school year you could probably find me at K-State in our robotics lab, but this summer I'm a intern doing software engineering work at SolutionWorks. At my university, I am currently a junior in computer engineering with a focus in multimedia and networking.

{% engineer hardware %}

**Addison Shaw**: Right now I’m using a screaming fast PC – the Lenovo T410. i5 processor @ 2.4 GHz, 4GB RAM (Needs liquid nitrogen) No dual monitor. No mouse. At home I use a ASUS G74SX – Core i7, 12GB RAM, 1.5 TB 7200 rpm storage. I’ve got a server hosted in New York that I use for personal projects. I also have an iPhone and a 22” Dell monitor.

**Richard Habeeb**: I built my own custom desktop rig with an AMD hex-core processor, Nvidia GTX 470, and 16 GB of RAM. I have a 64 GB SSD, so that is definitely my next big upgrade.

{% engineer software %}

**Addison Shaw**: I like trying out new software all the time, and I’ve coded in lots of environments like most. I’m most familiar with VS and eclipse, though I do a lot of scratch work in Notepad++ on windows and gedit on linux. I use PuTTY and FileZilla throughout the day.  I’m a huge fan of IRC and I use foobar2000 to keep track of all my music.

**Richard Habeeb**: While I would prefer to be developing on a Linux distro, the various software I need require me to use Windows, so I am running Windows Server 2012. For Git visualizations, I prefer SourceTree, and for web development I have been recently I have moved over to Aptana and Crunch.

{% engineer dream %}

**Addison Shaw**: In a lofty penthouse, I’d like an indefinitely supported PC with dual 4k monitors.

**Richard Habeeb**: My dream setup would probably include one of the new fancy 4K displays for my desktop and a Macbook Air for light traveling.
