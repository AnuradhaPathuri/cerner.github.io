{% engineer about %}

I've been developing software at Cerner since 2002. I currently lead a team that develops native client-side solutions using Java, specifically Eclipse RCP and Java web services. In addition to my day-to-day software responsibilities, I also help run our DevCenter, part of our new associate training program. I'm also heavily involved in trying to promote the software engineering culture at Cerner including the creation of this blog, internal and external conferences, and other opportunities for our engineers to interact beyond the scope of their roles.

When not engineering health, I'm probably strumming chords, brewing beer, grilling things, watching tv/movies, playing games, or wrenching on something. My closet is full of graphic t's, many of which have a cat on them and I've been told that I wear crazy socks. Comedy podcasts are generally playing when I'm at home. Internet memes crack me up.

{% engineer hardware %}

At work and home, I use a 17" Macbook Pro. My portable needs are handled by an iPhone 4S, iPad Mini, and 2nd gen Kindle. An Apple TV and Xbox 360 provide my home entertainment needs while I await the installation of Google Fiber.

The other hardware in my life are a 2002 Acura RSX Type-S, Breedlove Atlas C350, Weber Genesis and Weber Smokey Mountain, 5 gallon homebrew setup (brewing & dispensing), every tool needed to disassemble (and hopefully reassemble) a pre-1980s car, and an Osprey Porter 46.

{% engineer dream %}

My dream setup would be an ultra portable device that is virtually indestructible and continuously sync'd to the cloud. It would have blazingly fast cellular internet access and the ability to easily adapt to various form factors. Oh and it has to fit in my pocket, be able to dual boot either a full-blown OS or mobile OS, and have a keyboard and screen that are equally portable. A decent travel guitar wouldn't hurt, either.
