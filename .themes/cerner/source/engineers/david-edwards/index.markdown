{% engineer about %}

I currently have executive responsibility for our Cloud Engineering group, which develops a broad range of infrastructure services that help accelerate the delivery of healthcare solutions to market. I happen to be surrounded by an incredibly talented group of engineers and technical managers that make my job much easier. It is not uncommon to hear me telling friends and colleagues that I am forever an engineer trapped in an executive body. As a consequence, I have an insatiable appetite to learn new things even though at times it feels like a curse.

In a past life, I developed client/server middleware and systems infrastructure in C++, then moved to doing similar things in Java. Nowadays, I spend what few cycles I have studying distributed systems, scalable computing, and functional programming. Outside of work, I enjoy cycling, exploring new restaurants, international travel, and solving very large Rubik’s cubes.

{% engineer hardware %}

At work, my primary device is a 17” MacBook Pro with 8GB RAM. I love the screen real estate and portability is essential. At home, I have a 27” iMac with 12GB RAM, an 11” MacBook Air with 8GB RAM, and an iPad 2, all running just fine and dandy over Google Fiber.

{% engineer software %}

When someone catches me writing code, I’m usually editing Scala in either Sublime Text or Eclipse and running builds via sbt in iTerm2..

{% engineer dream %}

If Apple would build such a thing, a 17” MacBook Pro with Retina display, 64GB RAM and 1TB SSD.
