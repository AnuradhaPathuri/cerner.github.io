{% engineer about %}

I love code. I've been writing it for Cerner since 2010, working on Rails apps, search infrastructure, Java services, and Hadoop- and Storm-based data processing. Outside of technology, some of my hobbies are studying philosophy and playing piano.

{% engineer hardware %}

Apple owns my soul: 15" MacBook Pro, 11" MacBook Air, 21" iMac, iPhone, and iPad Mini. I use an extra monitor paired with a Raspberry Pi to cycle through a set of dashboards.

{% engineer software %}

Sublime, IntelliJ, iTerm, Chrome, Colloquy, and Outlook account for most of my day, along with a Ruby REPL for miscellaneous tasks.

{% engineer dream %}

My current one, but with a strawberry-lemonade fountain at my desk.
