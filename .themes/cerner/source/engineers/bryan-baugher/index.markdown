{% engineer about %}

I graduated from the University of Missouri in 2011 with degrees in Computer Science and Mathematics and immediately started my career with Cerner in spring of 2011. There I joined the BigData team helping them create libraries and services used by projects like Millenium+ and Population Health to make big data easier.

{% engineer hardware %}

I mostly work on a MacBook Pro with a second monitor at work. At home I have some desktop from college running Windows and all my games.

{% engineer software %}

I mostly use Eclipse and sometimes IntelliJ for development and Sublime or VIM for text editing.

{% engineer dream %}

A top of the line laptop with lots of RAM and SSD running some kind of Windows/Unix hybrid OS because I should have to choose between games and development.
