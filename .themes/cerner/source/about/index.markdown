At Cerner, we solve complex problems with an innovative edge; we are the brains that focus on making you, your family, and friends healthy and happy.

We are a group of fun, creative, empowered, and collaborative engineers and interaction experts with a unique opportunity to develop tools, sites, and applications to improve the health of your community. We are a casual group that wear jeans, t-shirts, and flip flops while coding or designing. We host a multitude of internal engineering events such as Hacknights, Hackathons, and an annual Developer Conference to invest in and recognize our innovators.
